Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

stocks,Reddit overtakes X in popularity of social media platforms in UK $RDDT,"[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk)

Reddit, the American online discussion platform, has overtaken X to become the fifth most popular social media platform in the UK, according to the communications watchdog.

Ofcom said Reddit, where users post on discussion threads within topic-based communities, was visited by 22.9 million UK adults in May this year, compared with 22.1 million on X.

The figures make Reddit the fastest-growing large social media platform in the UK and represent a growth of 47% on the same period in 2023. The leap took Reddit above LinkedIn and X into fifth place on the table of UK social media platforms, which is now topped by YouTube after it overtook [Facebook](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook), reaching more than 44 million adults.

Reddit, renowned for its devoted user base who refer to one another as Redditors, appears to have been boosted by updates to Google’s search engine this year.

Farhad Divecha, the managing director of the UK-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast, said: “Google’s latest algorithm update in the first half of 2024 gave Reddit a big boost in organic search traffic. I think that has probably contributed a lot.”

Ofcom also speculated that the change may have been caused [by alterations to how third-party apps accessed its content](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/14/reddit-moderators-vow-to-continue-blackout-in-api-access-fees-row), forcing users of those apps to switch to the Reddit site. The watchdog also flagged publicity around Reddit’s stock market flotation in March this year.

The popularity of X also fell over the same period, according to Ofcom, with its reach falling by 8% since May last year. X has been criticised over content moderation standards since its [takeover by Elon Musk in 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/28/elon-musk-twitter-hate-speech-concerns-stock-exchange-deal) but it has also faced competition since July 2023 from Threads, a rival to X [launched by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/06/meta-launches-twitter-rival-threads-in-100-countries).

The Ofcom figures featured in the watchdog’s annual report into the nation’s digital habits, which revealed that four out of 10 UK adults say they have encountered misinformation or deepfakes, with the majority of those cases occurring online.

The misinformation survey, based on a poll of more than 4,000 UK adults, also found that three in 10 adults believe there is a single group of people who control the world together, with the same number believing there is “significant evidence” of electoral fraud in the UK.

The regulator also found that one-third of UK adults are not confident in judging whether an image or a piece of audio or video has been created by artificial intelligence.",480,92,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h1x2aj/reddit_overtakes_x_in_popularity_of_social_media/

stocks,I think bird flu risk is being underestimated by the market. Long on $MRNA,"So far H5N1 has been slowly making it’s way from chickens to cows (around the middle of 2024) and now pigs in Oregon (within the last couple weeks). There have been a few mild human cases, basically all in farm workers working closely with infected animals. Although there was at least one case recently where they had no idea where the patient got infected from.

Normally, CDC will be tracking all this and keeping tabs on isolation of infected communities/individuals. This flu seems to be most prevalent in the US than other countries so far, and we have much more transparency and observability than China. So my risk assessment for this has been pretty low until Trump got elected.

But Trump has been making it very very clear that he’s going to pull every stop to deport undocumented migrants. Most of the people working in shitty conditions in farms are…undocumented. Undocumented workers are normally able to access some level of public services like healthcare, but this is about to get completely shut down by the Trump admin. And these farm workers are about to get shoved into concentrated compartments with really poor hygiene conditions, and it’s going to take a long time for them to actually get processed and deported. Many will run and hide, and that will also end up hiding how many people are actually infected and spreading the disease.

I think most people are expecting the Trump admin, especially under RFK Jr.'s health dept, to reduce spending on vaccines. But I think at a certain point, the rhetoric is bound to change, as more and more people get bird flu. After all, Operation Warp Speed was under the last Trump administration as well.

Moderna was given $176 million in July by the HHS to develop an mRNA bird flu vaccine. There already exists a bird flu vaccine made by CSL Seqirus, but I would imagine that the Trump administration will want to call upon a well-known American company to manufacture ""America first"" vaccines.

$MRNA has been down for many months, as the COVID hype worn down, but they [recently announced](https://www.biospace.com/business/moderna-slashes-r-d-budget-by-1-1b-eyes-10-approvals-through-2027) that they are reducing R&D expenses and focusing on 10 approvals by 2027. They've also been making huge jumps in the last week due to a [bullish sales view](https://www.investopedia.com/moderna-stock-jumps-following-bullish-sales-view-at-healthcare-conference-8750059).

stocks,Microsoft faces wide-ranging U.S. antitrust probe,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft, including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

The probe was approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan ahead of her likely departure in January. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, and the expectation he will appoint a fellow Republican with a softer approach toward business, leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air.  
  
The FTC is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms, sources confirmed earlier this month.  
  
The FTC is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products, the source said on Wednesday.

Microsoft declined to comment on Wednesday.  
  
The FTC fielded complaints about Microsoft last year as it examined the cloud computing market.

NetChoice, a lobbying group that represents online companies including Amazon and Google, which compete with Microsoft in cloud computing, criticized Microsoft’s licensing policies, and its integration of AI tools into its Office and Outlook.

“Given that Microsoft is the world’s largest software company, dominating in productivity and operating systems software, the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary,” the group said.  
The FTC has demanded a broad range of detailed information from Microsoft, Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday.  
  
Until now, Microsoft has been somewhat of an exception to U.S. antitrust regulators’ recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at Big Tech companies.  
  
Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Apple, and Amazon.com Inc. have all been accused by the U.S. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies.  
  
Alphabet’s Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.  
  
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google’s trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence.  
  
It is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.  
  
Still, Microsoft has benefited from Trump policies in the past.  
  
In 2019, the Pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win. Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit.

stocks,PayPal: A Path Back to Its Historical Strength and Growth Potential,"PayPal, once a darling of the fintech space, has seen its valuation contract significantly over the past few years. With its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently hovering around 20, the stock is far below its historical average of 43. A return to that average, driven by projected earnings of $5.71 per share by 2025, would imply a stock price north of $246—an opportunity that many investors might be overlooking. But for PayPal to reclaim its historical valuation, much must fall into place.

The foundation of PayPal’s future lies in its strategic initiatives, beginning with the integration of its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD). Introduced in 2023, PYUSD is more than just another digital currency; it is PayPal’s bridge to the future of blockchain-powered commerce. Unlike many failed stablecoin experiments, PYUSD is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits and Treasuries, giving it the stability and trustworthiness needed to thrive. The potential for PYUSD to facilitate global cross-border payments and power decentralized finance (DeFi) applications is immense. PayPal’s ability to capitalize on this innovation could redefine its relevance in the financial ecosystem.

Beyond cryptocurrency, PayPal is making waves with a growing advertising business that has largely flown under the radar. By leveraging its immense trove of transactional data from over 400 million active users, the company is building a platform that allows merchants to create highly targeted and effective marketing campaigns. This advertising arm, though still in its early stages, has the potential to generate billions in annual revenue. Even modest success here could have a significant impact on PayPal’s top line, creating another compelling growth driver.

Innovation has always been at the heart of PayPal’s strategy, and recent developments like the Fastlane checkout system showcase its commitment to staying ahead. This one-click guest checkout feature, paired with partnerships with major platforms like Shopify and Fiserv, enhances the company’s offerings for merchants and consumers alike. Meanwhile, initiatives like the CashPass rewards program deepen user engagement and loyalty, ensuring that PayPal remains a go-to solution for everyday transactions.

Leadership will play a critical role in PayPal’s resurgence, and newly appointed CEO Alex Chriss appears well-suited for the task. With a proven track record at Intuit, Chriss has demonstrated his ability to foster innovation and deliver results. His focus on empowering small businesses aligns perfectly with PayPal’s strengths and provides a roadmap for future growth.

But the journey back to a P/E of 43 will require more than just strategic initiatives and innovation. PayPal needs to rebuild investor confidence. The company must consistently deliver strong earnings, improve operational efficiencies, and effectively communicate its vision to the market. Transparent updates on key growth areas—such as PYUSD adoption, advertising revenue, and merchant partnerships—will be crucial in shaping the market’s perception of PayPal’s potential.

A return to PayPal’s historical valuation isn’t just about numbers; it’s about the story the company tells and the trust it rebuilds with investors. If PayPal can execute on its strategy, the potential reward is not just a higher stock price but a reaffirmation of its position as a leader in the fintech space. For those willing to look beyond the current market sentiment, PayPal’s path to $246 offers a compelling narrative of transformation, growth, and untapped opportunity.

TL;DR: PayPal is undervalued at a P/E of 20 compared to its historical average of 43. To return to its peak valuation, it must capitalize on its stablecoin (PYUSD), grow its new advertising business, and leverage innovative products like Fastlane Checkout. Under CEO Alex Chriss, with strategic execution and strong earnings, PayPal could see a stock price of $246 by 2025, reaffirming its leadership in fintech.

via [MSNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/27/pce-inflation-october-2024.html):

* The personal consumption expenditures price index increased 0.2% on the month and showed a 12-month inflation rate of 2.3%, both in line with expectations.
* Core inflation showed even stronger readings, with an increase at 0.3% on a monthly basis and an annual reading of 2.8%, also as forecast.
* Spending rose 0.4% on the month, as forecast, while personal income jumped 0.6%, well above the 0.3% estimate.

Investment thesis: The surge in AI applications has significantly increased demand for TSMC’s advanced chips. In Q3 2024, net profit rose 54% year-over-year to NT$325.3 billion (US$10.1 billion), exceeding forecasts. AI-related products are expected to contribute 15% of TSMC’s revenue in 2024, up from 5% in 2023. TSMC plans to commence mass production of 2-nanometer chips in Taiwan by 2025, maintaining its competitive edge. 
TSMC is diversifying its manufacturing footprint with significant investments in the U.S. and Japan. In Arizona, TSMC is constructing fabs expected to begin production between 2025 and the decade’s end. In Japan, TSMC, in partnership with Sony, opened a chip plant in February 2024 and plans a second facility by 2027.

stocks,Could Coinbase enter the S&P 500 in the Dec Rebalance? What do you think!,"[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) Global Inc. (COIN) has demonstrated significant growth, meeting several key benchmarks considered by the S&P 500 Index Committee. However, its performance is closely tied to the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin. This correlation is evident, as Coinbase's stock price often mirrors Bitcoin's fluctuations. For instance, during bullish Bitcoin trends, Coinbase experiences increased trading volumes and revenues, leading to higher stock valuations. Out off all the likely companies [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) is in my top 3 for inclusion this Rebalance.  
  
The forthcoming S&P 500 rebalance will indeed be indicative of the Index Committee's perspective on integrating companies like Coinbase, which are deeply embedded in the cryptocurrency sector. Inclusion of such a company would signal a significant shift towards embracing the evolving financial landscape and acknowledging the growing prominence of digital assets. Conversely, opting not to include Coinbase might suggest a more cautious approach, reflecting concerns about the inherent volatility and regulatory uncertainties associated with the crypto market. Therefore, the committee's decision will not only impact Coinbase but also serve as a broader statement on the acceptance of digital asset platforms within traditional financial indices.

[TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/fiO01sTb-Dynamic-Relationship-Between-Bitcoin-and-Coinbase/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The S&P 500 Index Committee employs specific criteria for inclusion, such as market capitalisation, liquidity, domicile, public float, and financial viability. While Coinbase may satisfy these quantitative measures, the committee also exercises qualitative judgment, considering factors like market stability and the company's role within its industry.

[Corporate Finance Institute](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/sp-500-index/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Given Coinbase's substantial exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency market, the committee might deliberate on the potential risks associated with such volatility. The decision to include a company so intertwined with the crypto sector would reflect the committee's stance on the evolving financial landscape and its readiness to integrate digital asset platforms into traditional indices.

In summary, while Coinbase appears to meet the fundamental requirements for S&P 500 inclusion, its strong correlation with Bitcoin introduces considerations that the committee will likely scrutinise, balancing traditional financial principles with the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market.",0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h1z88c/could_coinbase_enter_the_sp_500_in_the_dec/

stocks,Huge Insider Buying at Prospect Capital $PSEC,"Prospect capital's share price took a big hit last month and it was due to an audio forcing them to take a loss on investments that will bring in revenue soon. This dividend stock is way undervalued. And the insider buying lately backs up that thesis. 

  
The CEO has purchased nearly 4.2 million shares or over $20 million! he takes 0 Salary! The President has a salary of 175K and has purchase about that in shares! Every day this week I get SEC filings saying they are buying more. See for yourself:

[https://www.prospectstreet.com/investors/Docs/InsiderFilings/](https://www.prospectstreet.com/investors/Docs/InsiderFilings/)

Yesterday somebody I follow took a call from the company and told us this:

""The Chief Credit Officer at PSEC called me about 11am yesterday. Steven Stone. I was surprised it was from a cell phone. We spoke in February for about 50 mins as well. I have actually met the CEO 3x, last about 13 years ago at an annual shareholders meeting. I first attended in my 20s, was in the city. 1 thing you should know about PSEC is that it is a super defensive stock. The idea is, it is supposed to stay level, about 6, and supposed to give you near 12% in dividends, while having a steady price… We can see that has happened in this market, but that is the idea. It is always good to diversify… I had called and thought the drop off was do to their main REIT business. That business has about 70 multi family properties. Some with 100s of units. Those properties are not prime areas, they are 2^(nd)/3^(rd) tier.. They cash flow well, but on paper, they can depreciate, the asset value, prime can depreciate a lot! So this quarter the value of the REITS were written down much harder than the past, this is determined by their auditor… Every quarter there 117 investments must be appraised…. The loss and bad quarter is on 3 companies. 1 of which they finally did take a write off of near 120 million! PGX a credit repair service. The original owners took out nearly 200 million loan. When they could no longer pay the loan back, as the Govt fined and halted the business, they could not pay it… So PSEC took it over. It has a lot of upside, the margins there are high. We had spoke about this in February and had hoped that the service would be up and running. But it is still shut down, so the auditor forced them to take the loss… This is on paper! They didn’t lose the cash, the cash was loaned out. Hence the EPS will look bad.. They did earn less income because the other 2 of 3 that messed this quarter up, are failing. PSEC suspended interest payments on these 2. 1 of these holds a 180 million loan. PSEC cut the dividend and has chosen to take over these 2 businesses for a turn around. When turned they may sell the business and reap rewards.. Personally, hearing about these other 2, EH! But the credit repair is a cash cow.""

I have 2000 shares in my Roth and in my trading account. Not financial advice but worth a look.

I think I'm gonna open a position on EC, it's got a P/E ratio of 4.58, it's at a close-to historic low, and I think the fundamentals are there. It's got good cash albeit with some debt, it's subsizdized by the columbian government and provides 3% of their total GDP. Gustav Petro is a leftist president but he has a right-leaning congress and likely won't impact the company any more than he already has, he's also pretty unpopular and will likely be voted out in 2026.

stocks,Deep dive into Kering - From Timber to Gucci: A Legacy of Acquisitions,"**1.0 Introduction**

Let’s start with a fun fact. Kering, the company that owns brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, and Alexander McQueen, started as a **timber-trading company**.

Although it started back in 1962 and operated in a different industry, its DNA and management style haven’t changed much.

As I’m writing this, its share price is **down over 70%** from its peak back in August 2021 that was elevated due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

  
**2.0 The journey from timber to luxury**

***2.1 The timber period (1962 - 1988)***

The company was founded in France by François Pinault back in 1962 with a 100,000 francs loan from the bank. The business grew rapidly by **acquiring** many failing local timber traders in France, especially in the 1980s. By 1988, it owned 180 companies and 33 factories.

***2.2 The switch from timber to retail to luxury (1988 - 2013 - present)***

In 1988, it was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and the first transformation from timber to retail started:

* It merged with CFAO (A French distribution conglomerate)
* Acquired Conforama (French furniture retailer)
* Acquired Printemps (Department stores)
* Acquired 54% of La Redoute (French mail-order shopping retailer)
* Acquired Finac (French bookstore, multimedia, and electronics retailer)

The transformation from retail to luxury started in 1999 when it acquired 42% of **Gucci Group,** 100% of **Boucheron,** and 100% of **Yves Saint Laurent.** Today, Gucci accounts for 47% of its revenue.

François-Henri Pinault, the son of the founder François Pinault, became general manager of the company in 2003, and CEO in 2005. Under his leadership, the acquisitions in the luxury space continued.

It is important to note the divestments of their previous acquisitions (Conforama, Le Printemps, CFAO, and Fnac).

Its portfolio is quite diversified and includes:

* High-end clothing
* Footwear
* Handbags and leather goods
* Sunglasses and eyewear
* Scarves & other fashion accessories
* Jewelry
* Fragrances (due to the Creed acquisition)
* Cosmetics (in early stage)
* Watches

It is also geographically diversified:

* **APAC (excl. Japan)**: 32% of revenue
* **Western Europe**: 28% of revenue
* **North America**: 23% of revenue
* **Japan**: 8% of revenue
* **Rest of the World**: 9% of revenue

**3.0 Historical financial performance**

Its revenue increased from €15.9 billion in 2019, to €20.4 billion in 2022, and has contracted back to €18.4 billion as the demand for personal luxury goods started to decrease after the pandemic. 

Kering’s gross margin is stable at \~75%, meaning the direct costs are well controlled.

However, its operating margin is down below 20% (vs. 29% back in 2019). The explanation is simple.

**Reducing operating expenses is an incredibly tough job.**

When there’s less traffic (and subsequently less sales) in the physical stores, the operating expenses remain the same. The company still needs to pay the lease payment, its employees, the utility bills, etc. In fact, these expenses grow over time as there’s the impact of inflation.

Scaling down, by closing locations is also not a free option. Not only does it bring penalties for ending a lease contract earlier, but it also leads to losing all the revenue and profitability from that location.

The company is generating substantial cash flows, but I’ll argue the capital allocation is poor.

||all numbers in €m|
|:-|:-|
|Cash (January 2019)|€1.837|
|Operating cash flow|€21.541|
|Capex|(€7.772)|
|Acquisitions|(€6.559)|
|Debt|€4.887|
|Share buyback|(€2.034)|
|Dividends|(€8.229)|
|Other|€25|
|Cash (June 2024)|€3.696|

Between 2019 and H1-2024, the company generated **over €21.5 billion** in operating cash flow, or **a bit less than €14 billion after capex.**

Close to 60% of it was returned back to the shareholders via dividends, and an additional 15% through share buybacks. What’s left of the free cash flow, together with additional debt, was used for acquisitions.

Why do I think the capital allocation is poor? Two main reasons:

1. Almost 80% of the share buybacks were used in 2021 and 2022, the years when the share price was the highest (and temporarily elevated). A good capital allocator can recognize when the price is too high to buy back shares.
2. Its net debt position more than doubled, from **€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024. This is equal to \~60% of its market cap. The interest rate on their debt ranges from 0.75% to 5% and if the refinancing is done at a higher rate, it could significantly reduce its profit margins.



**4.0 What can be expected?**

Based on the latest investor presentation, there are three capital allocation priorities:

* Organic growth;
* Shareholder return; and
* Fuel high-potential adjacent businesses.

All of it, while having a **healthy financial situation and FCF generation.**

This is a good attempt by the management to summarize what to expect from the company. I find this slide a bit odd for three reasons:

1. On one side they want to return capital to the shareholders, which would position them as a company **with a goal to preserve capital and provide reliable dividends**. On the other side, its history is full of **acquisitions, which is the opposite of preserving capital.**
2. The center of the slide points to a healthy financial situation and FCF generation, while its net debt more than doubled in the last 5 years (**€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024).
3. Innovation is not a focus at all. Roughly 2 months ago, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced a partnership in the smart eyewear category. I see a lot of potential in this area that isn’t utilized (yet).

**Growing through acquisitions and distributing dividends seems to be the DNA of the company and likely what one should expect going forward.**

  
**5.0 Dividends**

The dividend per share has been steadily increasing from €4 back in 2015, to €14 in 2024. The current dividend yield is \~6%.

If the management focuses on reducing the debt and dividends (instead of borrowing to acquire more companies), Kering could become an incredibly appealing dividend investment option.

  
**6.0 High employee turnover**

At the end of 2023, the company had 48,964 employees. During the year, there were **13,403** new hires, and **11,275** employees departed. At first glance, this is no doubt a high turnover.

This sounds bad at first, but it is really difficult to decipher.

In theory, any company that has seasonal employment patterns will hire more employees (temporarily) during peak seasons. Therefore the increase, and subsequently decrease, of employees is normal. This is even more so in industries where the work is repetitive (such as sales and manufacturing).

In addition, 59% of the employees are Gen Y (1981-1995), a generation that is known for seeking career growth, which could lead to more job-hopping than average.

Given the reviews on Indeed, Glassdoor, and Comparably, there is no indication that this is currently a serious issue.

  
**7.0 The concerns**

**7.1 Balenciaga Advertising Scandal (2022)**

Back in 2022, Balenciaga faced significant backlash over their advertising campaign. One of them featured children holding teddy bears dressed in bondage-inspired outfits. This was rightfully criticized and labeled as inappropriate.

This brings into question the ethics behind those who are in charge of product development and marketing.

In addition, given how concentrated their portfolio is in the top 3 brands (Gucci - 46%, YSL - 17%, Bottega Veneta - 9%), scandals of this kind could have a significant impact.

**7.2 Preliminary investigation by the European Commission (2023)**

In April 2023, the European Commission initiated a preliminary investigation into potential antitrust violations within the fashion sector. One of the inspections took place at the Italian premises of Gucci.

An investigation of this kind does not imply guilt, but if a company is found in breach of EU antitrust rules, there could lead to a fine of a few billion euros.

The investigation is still ongoing, and no conclusions have been reached.

  
**8.0 Valuation** 

This is a mature market that will be around for a very long time. Therefore, here are my assumptions when it comes to valuing Kering:

* **Revenue** \- The industry is cyclical in nature, so there will be good and bad times. Based on the past, I do not feel confident that Kering can take market share, so I expect its growth to normalize at \~3% per year, which is in line with the inflation rate.
* **Operating margin** \- The luxury market is getting more crowded, and as argued earlier, reducing operating expenses is not an easy task. Once the demand is somewhat stable, I expect the operating margin to increase to 21%.

Based on those assumptions (and a discount rate of \~9%), the fair value of the company is **€27 billion (€220/share)** which is very close to the current price of **€224/share**.

This offers an IRR of \~9%, which is slightly below the historical return of the S&P500.

  
**8.1 The Bull Case**

Those who are betting on Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue growth and margin expansion through some of the following:

* Revitalization of Balenciaga & rebuilding its reputation after the controversies;
* Sustained growth in Gucci, and expansion of secondary brands like Bottega Veneta & Saint Laurent;
* The success of its newly launched beauty division, capturing market share from rivals like LVMH and Estee Lauder;
* Positive macro tailwinds;

* Utilizing pricing power;
* Integration of recent acquisitions;
* Reducing operating costs;

**If the management can pull this off, then the value per share could be 2x from today’s share price.**



**8.2 The Bear Case**

Those who are betting against Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue decline and margin compression through some of the following:

* Brand mismanagement & more scandals;
* Inability to revitalize Balenciaga;
* Inability to innovate around its primary brands;
* Failure to integrate its acquisitions & further poor M&A acquisitions;
* Negative macro tailwinds;
* Inability to innovate around E-Commerce;
* Supply chain issues;
* Competitive pressure;
* Increase in corporate tax by the French authorities

**In this scenario, the fair value per share could be below €100/share.**

stocks,Looking for advice: combining technical analysis with news-based and high-volatility trading,"Hi everyone,
I’ve been trading more actively lately, focusing on high-volatility stocks and news-based opportunities. This year has been very successful for me. I’ve managed to achieve returns that were even above the S&P 500, so I’m really happy with my progress.

That said, I’m always looking to improve, and I’m wondering if integrating technical analysis into my approach could help me refine my strategy further. I usually hold my positions for a few days to a few weeks. I have a few questions:
	
1.	Which technical indicators would you recommend for someone trading on a short to medium term basis and reacting to news-driven moves?
	
2.	Are there specific timeframes or chart setups that work better for trades lasting days or weeks? 
	
3.	Are there any books, courses, or resources you’d recommend for learning technical analysis, especially for high-volatility setups?
	
4.	How do you handle risk management when trading in such volatile environments?

5.   How can I identify which stocks are likely to have the highest trading volume or volatility during the day ?

I know there’s no one size fits all solution, but I believe combining fundamental insights with technical analysis could help me make better informed decisions.


Thanks in advance to anyone who shares their experience or advice!

stocks,$Dell Earnings ,"I wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run. Didn’t sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150.

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024.

stocks,Rivian Receives Conditional Commitment for up to $6.6 Billion Loan from the U.S. Department of Energy,"RVINE, Calif., November 26, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--American all-electric automaker Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced it has received conditional commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program for a loan of up to $6.6 billion (including $6 billion of principal and approximately $600 million of capitalized interest) to accelerate its growth and leadership of electric vehicle design, development and manufacturing in the United States.

If finalized, the loan would support the construction of Rivian’s next facility in Stanton Springs North, near the city of Social Circle, Georgia, substantially expanding the company’s domestic production capacity to support demand from the United States and international markets. This loan from DOE would provide significant funding for production of the company’s midsize platform, which underpins the R2, a midsize SUV, and the R3/R3X, a midsize crossover. Designed, engineered, and built in America to deliver an incredible combination of capability, function, performance, and pricing, Rivian believes its R2 and R3 vehicle lines will be critical drivers in the company’s long-term growth and profitability.

The DOE loan would provide an important boost to the U.S. automotive industrial base, enabling significant job creation and investment that is important for the United States to maintain its leadership as electric vehicles become a strategically important industry.

Rivian intends to build the facility in two phases, each resulting in 200,000 units of annual production capacity, for a total of 400,000 units of annual capacity–supporting the sale of American EVs in international markets. Phase 1 of the project is expected to start production in 2028. Rivian is expected to create approximately 7,500 operations jobs through 2030 at the company’s future manufacturing facility in Georgia. This is in addition to 2,000 expected full-time construction jobs that will utilize the region’s significant talent and workforce to further strengthen the domestic EV ecosystem. These jobs complement the thousands Rivian has already created and plans to maintain at its current plant in Normal, Illinois, which have bolstered the local and regional economy.

""This loan will help create thousands of new American jobs and further strengthen U.S. leadership in EV manufacturing and technology,"" said Rivian Founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. ""This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability. A robust ecosystem of U.S. companies developing and manufacturing EVs is critical for the U.S. to maintain its long-term leadership in transportation.""

Rivian plans to design and build a fully modern manufacturing facility at the Stanton Springs Site, less than one hour’s drive from downtown Atlanta, employing modern construction techniques and advanced environmental management while preserving natural spaces and investing actively in the surrounding communities.

Over the history of the loan program, DOE has helped energize American EV manufacturing with billions in financing for this strategically important industry, including loans to General Motors and Tesla.

While this conditional commitment indicates DOE’s intent to finance the project, DOE and the company must satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions before the Department of Energy enters into definitive financing documents and funds the loan. If finalized, the loan would be secured by all assets of the project and fixed assets and guarantees of the parent company, Rivian Automotive, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries.

stocks,Opinions on ZETA?,"
I have watched this stock for some time and it is super interesting.

• Culper research shorts ZETA and publishes findings on some misconducts from ZETA.

• Shares drop big time

• ZETA responds to all claims from culper and
""proves"" them as lies. One of examples is that Culper mentiones EY as ZETA's auditor but EY was never ZETA's auditor. It was always Deloitte...

• ZETA insiders buy large amount of shares as another sign to support the company and that Culper research is lying and playing dirty.

• Shares bounce back a bit.

• Former Louisiana attorney general leads class action suit against ZETA (another dirty move to stop a bounce back or honestly concerned ex politician?).

• Shares drop this week again.

Isn't it crazy how few people can destroy a company for personal interest using deception and dirty tricks? Or is the company the one that is corrupt?

In my opinion Culper clearly lied on many things as a strategy for their short positions, history showed that companies that were shorted by Culper did just fine in the future. Is this case the same?

What is your opinion on this? Is it good entry point, is it too risky to enter.

Btw fundamentals of this company are good.
Healthy growth, nice debt ratio and management, strong institutional ownership etc.

stocks,"California plan excludes Tesla from new EV tax credits, governor's office says","Tesla's electric vehicles likely would not qualify for California's new state tax credits under a proposal in the works if President-elect Donald Trump scraps the federal tax credit for EV purchases, Governor Gavin Newsom's office said on Monday.
Tesla shares closed down 4%.

Trump's transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7,500 for EV purchases, Reuters reported this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

stocks,Speculate on GOOG - what'd be the best countermove against DoJ slaps? ,"For those who were sleeping/partying on the weekend, the following happened:

* DoJ said, Google should divest off Chrome and may not reenter the browser market for five years
* prohibited from ""acquiring any interests in search rivals, potential entrants, and rival search or search ads-related AI products""
* halt all ""anticompetitive payments to distributors, including Apple, Samsung"" so that Google isn't the default search engine on their devices
* content creators can choose to opt-out of Google crawlers to train its AI

Most obvious historical comparison is case against Microsoft Corp. in 2001; the DoJ tried to split Microsoft up due to its hold over the web browser market on Windows, though this case **ultimately resulted in a settlement**. With that in mind, it is possible, the DoJ will go this way, this time.

* Search is close to 50% revenue of Google \[Q3 results\]
* Browsers market shares: Chrome 60%, Safari 18%, Edge 8% \[Source can be contested, because it's larger devices stats only\]
* Android - 70% market share in handheld devices

GOOG has to fight hard to ensure a high search traffic. It may have a few options up its sleeves.

stocks,MDA Space blowing up by year’s end (contract incoming),"All this hype with RKLB, LUNR, and RDW and no-one is mentioning MDA (mktcap - 3.2b CAD). Yeah I know it mainly trades on Toronto but just get a broker that supports Toronto, eg IBKR. They’re planning to list on US soon but by then it will probably already have taken off...

Their earnings report was stellar: growth of 38% yoy, it is actually **PROFITABLE** \- none of the other space companies are profitable - profitability with adjusted EBITDA of $55.5 million, up 30% YoY, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.7%, net income up 60% yoy, and net debt adjusted EBITDA ratio of just 0.8x (so zero risk of dilution). However, post earnings the stock was mostly flat. Why? Their reported backlog was unchanged from previous quarter report (backlog is 4.6B btw).

But if any of you folks had bothered to tune in to the call, you would have heard the CEO say that it is a fact that by year end they will be **definitely be signing a new contract worth 750M** – of these, only 300M is recorded in backlog – a**n additional $450M is going to be added** upon finalization and t**his will happen by year’s end.** They in fact stated during the Q&A that they are confident they will be finishing 2024 with $5B backlog. They also said MDA’s satellite systems division alone has a $**15B+ pipeline** of potential projects, thanks to its Aurora-class satellites tailored for low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations.

Still not convinced? Consider:

\> MDA is building a new 185,000 sq. ft. facility in Quebec, **capable of producing two satellites per day** starting in late 2025.

\>Planet labs is currently generating about 200million in revenue per year. MDA’s geointelligence segment is also generating about 200million in revenue per year. However, MDA’s geo segment represents **only about 20%** of MDA’s total revenue. PL’s marketcap is currently almost **1B**. MDA is 3.1 CAD = **2.2B USD**. Oh, and PL is currently operating at a loss (though that might change next report) but MDA is running a profit. Based on this fact alone, MDA’s mkt cap should be at least double than what it is.

stocks,Ganja Bear Case (and one possible exception),"I think cannabis is an abysmally bad investment opportunity (with one exception) and almost no one knows why, because the precise nature of how THC as a drug operates isn't well understood by people who aren't both habitual consumers \*and\* up-to-date with knowledge on that sector this past decade or so.

It's the following issue: Let's say it's 2010 when cannabis is still illegal everywhere and I want to get high, I light up a single (1) joint with my friend, we smoke for 20 minutes, and then we're giggling. We go to buy some twice a month or so. A few years later it's been legalized and a ton of money floods into the space. Growers are all trying to compete with each other to take advantage of the laws changing, everyone wants to make stronger weed that gets you high more quickly than the other kinds, to draw customers to them, get market share and so on. ""Buy my iridescent purple galactic stardust reefer that gets you as high in one puff as 10x that amount of the neighboring place's stuff.""

This is a race to the bottom. Soon everyone is selling incredibly strong stuff, but you need \*far less\* of it to get the same high. Habitual users spend less than 10% of what they used to on weed now, everything is absurdly strong and cheap because of this competition. In addition you now have hash oil, edibles, dab pens, tinctures, you name it. Not just regular flower.

I never smoked much anyway, but in the rare case I want a mini-vacation now, I can take a vial of Tincture and put \*one drop\* under my tongue. Within two hours the world is spinning. It's so strong I never use it as anything other than a sleeping aid about once a month. A single bottle of this costs about $65, and it comfortably lasts me an entire year. This is a disaster for the industry because I almost never need to give them business. It's so strong that I rarely need to make a purchase at all. And no need for all the paraphernalia with it either. No vapes, pipes, lighters etc. The bottle comes with an eyedropper. Even if I use it often and develop a high tolerance, I still rarely need to go out for more. My friend and I have no reason to go smoke or spend much money on the supplies for it when for 1/100th the price we can get the same high now, assuming one of us has a tincture (or dab vape pen, or edible, or a newly exotic and potent strain) at home.

Compare this with alcohol, where you can't make, say, vodka much stronger than it is. It's impossible for me to come up with a 10x stronger vodka to put my competitors out of business because it's physically impossible for alcohol to exist at room temperature at concentrations higher than \~97% (I think), and vodka is already around 45% and can't reasonably go much higher (taste etc). Also there is a social nature to it that weed lacks, beer works more as a refreshment beverage like coke etc.

Or cigarettes, where even if you have a huge nicotine tolerance from constant Zyn use, the nature of the substance requires you to take it every couple hours to keep from getting jittery. You can't just get a year's supply of nicotine in a bottle because (first of all it'd be fatal with a slight dosage error) you need to have it in measured amounts you can take every 2-4 hours regardless of how much you're used to consuming, assuming you're dependent on it to begin with of course. And so it is a consistent business for sellers. This is most true of cigarettes, but also applies to vapes and pouches, which have similarly excellent profit margins. All of these a nicotine addict must consume regularly. Regulations also limit how much nicotine you can put in each product.

It is a subscription model, in short, while weed is equivalent to motor oil in terms of how often someone (a very heavy user to boot) has to go out and buy some, and how much they spend. Alcohol has some issues as well of lesser magnitude that I can go into elsewhere, but can lean on its usefulness in social situations whereas weed cannot.

The only exception to this? Turning Point Brands (TPB) stock, because they don't sell weed. They sell rolling papers and other paraphernalia for it. Which is indeed still a growing business if it gets legalized in more places and benefits from the greater proliferation of the stuff. Actual weed sellers do not, because the increased proliferation is offset by people needing to buy less of it for the same results due to increased THC concentration in the products. You can't sell 1/10th as much paper to people for the same effect, or at least it's less affected by this issue. The company also is wisely getting into nicotine pouches although this is very ambitious of them to compete with the tobacco majors directly on something. Not sure how that'll work out. Keep in mind this is a small cap company, less than $1 billion in market cap, reflecting how little profit there is to be made even on the periphery of this sector. But it's one small and thriving business I can find that has benefited from all this quite nicely. Not sure how much more it can grow, it's probably overvalued now, but in the past year or so it's risen strongly.

Otherwise? Cronos and other weed stocks? Bunk. For the birds. There might be an exception for medical marijuana (CBD) companies but that's pure conjecture as far as I know. You can make condensed CBD products just the same.",0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gzfcoy/ganja_bear_case_and_one_possible_exception/
stocks,Evaluation of Companies with Down Revenue,"I find this an interesting topic and am interested how others feel if a company would be considered potentially bullish with the following fundamentals.

- Cash flow per share growth (year over year)
- *Net profit margin growth (year over year)
- Lower long-term debt (year over year)

BUT ALSO HAS…

- Lower revenue (year over year)
- Lower net income (year over year)
- Lower earnings per share (year over year)

In my opinion when revenue (or net income) is declining, and not flat or increasing, it is a concern that the company could be on the brink of a big downturn. Especially in a continued pattern of these results.

However, I often see companies with these symptoms, (sometimes in different combinations but at least two of these are lower year over year), however the chart is very bullish at times…

Thoughts? (Thanks in advance for your opinion)

stocks,Anyone else concerned with this rally?,"I've been super happy since September to see my portfolio take off. I own stocks such as reddit, shopify, square & sofi which all have had fabulous runups in a short span.

Although I'm long on these names I'm seriously considering selling some or all of my shares and tossing it into a etf or nice slow growing dividend stock like mcdonalds or abbvie. 

I've been through this rodeo before where the market blasts off in a short window to just wreck my account.  Basically 2020-2021 and then all of 2022.

If I sell I'm looking at a larger tax bill but it only means I made money afterall.

I'm looking for advise, do you think its wise to start to take some off the table or have you started to sell?

stocks,Games Workshop up 15% following higher than expected quarterly sales!,"A few months ago I posted about Games Workshop and why I thought it was undervalued.  
TLDR: the new Space Marine II game was a hit and this would drive increased sales.

In the end, I decided to hold (thank God!)

Today GW announced significantly higher-than-expected quarterly sales, resulting in a 15% bump in stock price.

My hope is that this also makes an Amazon show deal more likely. This is clearly a popular and valuable IP and hopefully, this news will help get a deal over the line with Amazon.

I'm not sure if the stock is now fairly priced or still a little under-priced. I'd appreciate any community thoughts on this!

stocks,Delaware Funds by Macquarie,"Does anyone have any insight into Delaware Funds managed by Macquarie? 

Unfortunately, I was persuaded to purchase into one of the small / mid cap mutual funds in December 2020. Obviously the market was on a bit of a run there, but everything about the fund (historical build up, Morningstar ratings, length of existence of the fund, recommendations by publications, YoY performance,  etc) led me to believe it was a reasonable, if somewhat more aggressive, investment.  

It was all well and good for about a year, as the market rebounded from Covid and this particular fund hummed along with the rest of the economy.   Articles like [this in the mainstream press](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/4-stock-picks-for-the-post-pandemic-nesting-economy-from-a-five-star-money-manager-11636995166?mod=bnbh_mwarticle) lent further credence that the fund was solid and the fund managers respected by financial journalism. 

And then it did a capital gains distribution (historically very normal for this fund) in December 2021 and then the share price immediately started its plummet.  Like, overnight, lost $15/share.  Similarly, it went seemingly overnight from a Morningstar 5 rating to a 2 rating.  It continued to fall from there. 

  
I guess I am one of those silly buy and hold people.  I always assume that short term losses will eventually be made up in the long term.  Since then....no. 

  
Earlier this year, Delaware merged a couple of their funds, so DFDIX became IYMIX.   As far as I can tell, the holdings in IYMIX are not radically different than what DFDIX held.   In a market that has been turbo charged for the past year, the growths of this fund have been glacial.   I realize that the holdings are small / mid cap and those are ostensibly still being knocked around by high interest rates, but the three years since that initial freefall following the capital gains distribution has not really begun to make up the ground that the fund dramatically lost. 

I've literally never been in a mutual fund that actively lost money for me.  Plenty have not grown in dramatic ways, but actually halving of value?  That's never happened before. 

Does anyone have any insight into this investment company or explanation why a small / midcap fund would depreciate to such a dramatic extent and fail to recover over a period of years when stock market growth is explosive? 

  
I'm a little heartsick at the thought of just cutting losses and investing in Vanguard or something but it's been really stressful.  

Thanks in advance.  (And yes, I realize I should have been using trailing stops, but didn't, so no lectures there, please.)",11,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gy4ckp/delaware_funds_by_macquarie/

* **Earnings beat** revenue expectations with $6.82B (+18% YoY) and EPS of .92 (+31% YoY and spot on with projection) 
* Data center revenue surged **+122%**, proving AMD is gaining AI momentum.
* Recent selloff (-$30/share) was a **market overreaction** to slightly soft Q4 guidance.
* The market shifted focus to NVIDIA's upcoming earnings stalling an AMD rally.
* **Catalysts**: Workforce optimization, IBM partnership, and AI-focused leadership changes.

# The Setup

AMD is streamlining its org for an **AI-dominated future**:

1. **Reduction in Force**: Cutting 4% of workforce to focus on AI chip development.
2. **New Leadership**: CFO transition positions AMD for its next growth phase.
3. **IBM Partnership**: MI300X accelerators are now a key piece of IBM Cloud’s AI stack.

stocks,What I learnt from MSTR frenzy,"I have been a long term investor in MSTR, in fact buying  my position Pre-split.  
My thesis was very much connected to an alternative investment vehicle into Bitcoin.  Even though I have BTC as a holding in my crypto, I was more after exposure in an equity portfolio.

To cut a long story short, I bought it when it was no mainstream and no ETF's were existing.

I must admit, I sat on a loss for about one year in MSTR.  Buying at $48.10 (split adjusted), and for the longest time sitting at the $25-$30 range, BTC was consolidating and I was fine with that.

If people understand what MSTR are doing, this playbook with bonds and hedging BTC was already in play for a long time, I was lucky enough to understand this quite early and and bought it quite early.  The difference being now that BTC is on a breakout and other companies are now looking into this method as well, the eyes on MSTR has multiplied exponentially .

Fast forward one year, and and the FOMO crowd arrived, and with that volatility.

Here is what I learnt when the FOMO arrived:

1. The stock is no longer trading on anything but emotion and speculation.
2. Valuations do not matter anymore.  The premium on BTC was as low as 1.5 less than one year go, reaching a peak earlier this week at 3.5
3. The stock goes up like crazy, and comes down like crazy, and when this happens, it's time to exit as there is nothing that is in your control.
4. There is so much manipulation (e.g. the citron report, Social media, Mainstream coverage), on what... a damn tweet!  it is not really easy to understand how this will move, so at this point it is just gambling.

I held my position up to the $543 level, and eventually my stop losses triggered yesterday around the $500 level.  So after 1.5 years, I am out of the MSTR trade.

The lesson I learnt is when the crowds arrive, turn round and walk away.

I still believe in the MSTR playbook, but will only come back when I am at the front of the queue buying at a negotiated price not when I am in a bidding war with gamblers.",511,172,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gx4xb6/what_i_learnt_from_mstr_frenzy/
stocks,Thoughts and dilemma on Rocket Lab? ,"I went into Rocket Lab back in July with the intention of making it my primary long-term growth stock and since then have managed to acquire 440 shares at average price of around $9.  

My intention was/is to keep buying and hold the stock for many many years, because I truly believe in the company potential and the overall space industry and I believe that it will be a key growth sector for the next decade and beyond regardless of who is in power in the US. (I am not american btw)

Just before the election I was in profit in the low thousands, which was nice but since the election I am now sitting at a profit of 147%, which is my best position in my investing ""career"" so far. 

Like I said, I believe the company will do well regardless of who is in power. However, given the fast rise since the election I am expecting correction happening soon. 

And my dilemma is: should exit now and take the profits and then go back in after the correction? Or should I just hold until the potential correction and start buying more then?

stocks,Are we putting too much faith in generative AI? Could this hurt AI investments more broadly?,"Obviously a lot of money is being made off of AI-related stocks. I'm not one of those lucky investors. Part of the reason is that I fear we're not in a general AI bubble, as many have discussed, but rather a *generative AI* bubble. I'd appreciate hearing how others feel about this.

Right now, by far the bulk of investment is focused on generative AI (especially LLMs), with NVDA at or very near the center of it all, thanks to its GPUs. Meanwhile, alternative AI approaches (e.g., neuromorphic computing, symbolic AI, reinforcement learning, and hybrid models) have been getting far less attention.

The problem? As impressive as it may seem, generative AI has some significant (and inherent) drawbacks:

* Factually unreliable outputs (it can’t reliably distinguish fact from fiction)
* Probabilistic reasoning (no true causal understanding)
* High computational costs (questionable sustainability)
* Limited real-world problem-solving abilities

At some point, the reality of generative AI's limitations will become apparent enough to investors that we could see an AI market correction or even collapse. This would not only hurt AI stocks like NVDA, but it could also starve funding for alternative AI approaches that have long-term potential yet have been largely overlooked.

stocks,C3AI begins to turn the tide,"C3.ai shares jumped 25% in a single day on the announcement of a deeper partnership with Microsoft. The new agreement clarifies Microsoft Azure as C3.ai's preferred cloud services platform and C3.ai's AI applications as Azure's preferred enterprise solutions. Although the two have been working together since 2018, this announcement pushes the market's focus on its AI potential higher.

Underestimated potential: c3.ai's revenue grew 21% in the quarter and is expected to grow 24% going forward. Current market capitalization is \~$4 billion and trades at a multiple of 11x its FY2025 revenue target.

Pilots: The company has 224 pilots, 85% of which are active, representing a 117% year-over-year increase in the number of pilots. 70% of pilots are expected to be converted into formal contracts.

Future Potential: Revenues are expected to pick up to 30% from current growth rates through pilots to formal deals. 2026 FY projected revenue target is $462 million, with a share price potential of up to $36 if it reaches an 8x EV/revenue valuation.

While the partnership has boosted market enthusiasm, I would wait for market sentiment to pull back before getting in. In addition, the conversion of pilots to full-fledged programs is key to future growth.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

stocks,Intuit shares drop as quarterly forecast misses estimates due to delayed revenue,"Intuit shares fell 6% in extended trading Thursday after the finance software maker issued a revenue forecast for the current quarter that trailed analysts’ estimates due to some sales being delayed.

Here’s how the company performed in comparison with LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.50 adjusted vs. $2.35 expected

Revenue: $3.28 billion vs. $3.14 billion

Revenue increased 10% year over year in the quarter, which ended Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income fell to $197 million, or 70 cents per share, from $241 million, or 85 cents per share, a year ago.

While results for the fiscal first quarter topped estimates, second-quarter guidance was light. Intuit said it anticipates a single-digit decline in revenue from the consumer segment because of promotional changes for the TurboTax desktop software in retail environments. While that will affect revenue timing, it won’t have any impact on the full 2025 fiscal year.

Intuit called for second-quarter earnings of $2.55 to $2.61 per share, with $3.81 billion to $3.85 billion in revenue. The consensus from LSEG was $3.20 per share and $3.87 billion in revenue.

For the full year, Intuit expects $19.16 to $19.36 in adjusted earnings per share on $18.16 billion to $18.35 billion in revenue. That implies revenue growth of between 12% and 13%. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for $19.33 in adjusted earnings per share and $18.26 billion in revenue.

Revenue from Intuit’s global business solutions group came in at $2.5 billion in the first quarter. The figure was up 9% and in line with estimates, according to StreetAccount. Formerly known as the small business and self-employed segment, the group includes Mailchimp, QuickBooks, small business financing and merchant payment processing.

“We are seeing good progress serving mid-market customers in MailChimp, but are seeing higher churn from smaller customers,” Sandeep Aujla, Intuit’s finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts. “We are addressing this by making product enhancements and driving feature discoverability and adoption to improve first-time use and customer retention.”

Better outcomes are a few quarters away, Aujla said.

CreditKarma revenue came in at $524 million, above StreetAccount’s $430 million consensus.

At Thursday’s close, Intuit shares were up about 9% so far in 2024, while the S&P 500 has gained almost 25% in the same period.

On Tuesday Intuit shares slipped 5% after The Washington Post said President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed “Department of Government Efficiency” had discussed developing a mobile app for federal income tax filing. But a mobile app for submitting returns from Intuit is “already available to all Americans,” CEO Sasan Goodarzi told CNBC’s Jon Fortt.

Goodarzi said on CNBC that he’s personally communicating with leaders of the incoming presidential administration.

On the earnings call, Goodarzi sounded optimistic about the economy.

 I won't go into details of thier report, but after reading it I believe it is of very low quality (they even got the ZETAs auditor wrong lol).

After the decline of the price I was tempted to start building a position, especially since the SP was starting to recover. However, today in PM the shares are going back to around 20$.

She also published similiar articles on NVDA, APP, SNOW. But the market is dumping anyway.

stocks,Deep dive into Etsy - On a path to a dangerous spiral,"**1.0 Introduction**

Etsy started by brilliantly carving out a niche in handmade and vintage goods, but now it faces challenges that threaten its unique spot in e-commerce and I’ll argue it is going down the path to a dangerous spiral.

The idea to connect buyers with sellers of handmade/vintage goods is amazing, and there’s no doubt that there is demand for it.

Any marketplace has two important metrics:

* The **Gross Merchandise Value**, also known as “GMV”, represents the value of all products sold through the website. Etsy decided to use **Gross Merchandise Sales** (“GMS“), which is just a different term.
* The **take-rate** represents their share of the GMS.

Its GMS increased from \~$4 billion in 2018 (prior to the pandemic) to $13.5 billion in 2021. However, since then, Etsy has experienced a decline and the GMS in 2023 was $13.2 billion. The lack of growth is either a lack of demand or a lack of supply in the marketplace.

**2.0 The real problem**

The company discloses the number of active buyers and sellers, and together, they paint quite a picture.

The number of active sellers continued to grow. From 2021 to 2023, it increased from 7.5 million to 9 million.

The number of buyers has been flat.

Economics101 teaches us a simple lesson: ***If the demand is stable, and there is an increase in supply, the prices will decrease.***

Economics also teaches that ***lower prices would attract more buyers, increasing the demand.***

***So, where are the buyers?***

As Etsy doesn’t (and cannot) check the quality of all the products, more and more AI-generated product images combined with dropshipping flood the market. Here's a comment from a Reddit user that in my opinion does a great job summarizing the development:

""*Drop-shipping has absolutely ruined online marketplaces. I used to adore Etsy when it first started, but now its just absolute garbage. You have to reverse image search everything nowadays to make sure it's the real deal and actually handmade. This recently happened to me when I was trying to buy some pretty dice for my dnd group. Turned out it was a scam using a real artisan's pictures to sell their cheap shit. Thankfully, I was able to rectify the issue, but it was a hustle.*""

The U.S. sellers used to contribute over 75% of Etsy’s revenue a decade ago. Now, it’s down to \~50%.

I’ll argue that this might lead to a spiral that will harm Etsy in the long run, with the events being:

1. Increase in low-value products on Etsy.
2. The low-value products will be perceived as a better deal when compared to the high-value products as they are cheaper.
3. The sellers of high-value products will sell fewer products, and some of them will eventually leave Etsy.
4. The buyers will be disappointed by the low-value products and will not use Etsy as much (or at all).

**3.0 What is Etsy doing?**

Etsy is spending \~30% of its revenue on Marketing (vs. 20% a decade ago) and has even engaged in TV ads to raise awareness and bring new customers.

Over the last few years, the company has been spending $700-800m per year, only to keep the revenue flat. It is accepting the fact that buyers will be disappointed, and the strategy is to replace them with new ones.

**4.0 The take-rate**

The only other way for Etsy to grow its revenue is to increase its take-rate, and its share of the GMS.

The company splits its revenue into two groups:

* **Marketplace revenue** (\~73% of total) - These are **required** fees that cannot be avoided (Transaction fees, payment processing fees, listing fees).
* **Service revenue** (\~27% of total) - These are **optional**, such as on-site advertising, shipping labels, etc.

Its take-rate is incredibly high at \~21%, double from a decade ago. For comparison, eBay’s take rate is \~14%.

**5.0 Terrible management decisions**

As the company was reaching its peak, the management decided to make 3 large acquisitions:

* **Reverb** (Aug 15th, 2019) - A marketplace for new, used, and vintage music gear was acquired for **$270 million**.
* **Elo 7** (July 2nd, 2021) - Also known as the “Etsy of Brazil”, a Brazil-based marketplace for unique, handmade items was acquired for **$212 million**.
* **Depop** (July 12th, 2021) - a global fashion resale marketplace was acquired for \~**$1.5 billion**.

It is important to note that Depop had an annual revenue of **$70 million!** No, this is not a typo. Etsy paid over 20x its revenue to acquire Depop!

Well, not that long later, in Q3-2022, the company recorded impairment charges of **over $1 billion** for Depop and Elo7. No better way to destroy shareholders’ value quickly, than by overpaying for an acquisition.

A year later, in Q3-2023, Elo7 was sold at a loss.

**6.0 Historical financial performance**

Historically, this is still an impressive growth. Its revenue grew from <$200 million a decade ago, to $2.8 billion in the last twelve months and its gross margin remains stable at \~70%.

Its operating margin is lingering around 12% now, as both marketing & product development as % of revenue have been increasing. The increase in marketing expense (as % of revenue) has already been highlighted in a previous section. It is necessary to maintain the buyers’ base. So potential future improvements in the operating margin can only arise by decreasing the product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue).

**7.0 Valuation**

The two key variables when it comes to valuing a company are:

* **Revenue** \- Given that the number of active buyers hasn’t grown in the last few years, it is difficult to expect revenue growth above inflation.
* **Operating margin** \- I do think there’s room to improve the margins by reducing product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue). My assumption is that that it will increase to 14% over time.

Based on my input, the fair value of the company is **$3.2 billion ($29/share)**. This is significantly lower than the current market cap of **$5.7 billion ($51/share)**.

Anyone betting on Etsy is ultimately betting that:

1. The number of low-value products will decrease over time.
2. The number of buyers will start growing again
3. Etsy can continue increasing its take-rate, without losing sellers of high-value products.
4. The management will not engage in acquisition (as they are clearly bad at it).

stocks,"Gap shares surge as it raises guidance, touts ‘strong start’ to holiday","Hurricanes and unseasonably warm weather hit sales at Gap during its fiscal third quarter, but the apparel company still posted better-than-expected results, leading it to raise its annual guidance for a third time this year. 

Gap, which runs Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta and its namesake banner, is now expecting fiscal 2024 sales to be up between 1.5% and 2%, compared with previous guidance of “up slightly.” That’s ahead of the 0.4% growth that LSEG analysts had expected, and bodes well for the all-important holiday shopping season, which is now underway. 

The company is also anticipating gross margins and operating income will grow more than it previously expected.

Shares surged about 13% in extended trading.

Here’s how the nation’s largest specialty apparel retailer performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $3.83 billion vs. $3.81 billion expected

Gap’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $274 million, or 72 cents per share, compared with $218 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales rose to $3.83 billion, up about 2% from $3.78 billion a year earlier.

Across Gap’s business, unseasonably warm weather affected sales by about 1 percentage point during the quarter, while storms and hurricanes led overall store sales to fall by 2%, CEO Richard Dickson told CNBC in an interview. 

“We had unusual circumstances, hurricanes, storms that led to almost 180 closures at the peak of the impact,” said Dickson, adding the storms affected Old Navy, Gap’s largest brand by revenue, the most. 

As soon as the weather turned around, sales “rebounded” and the holiday shopping season is off to a “strong start” so far, said Dickson. 

“We are energized about the holiday. Our teams are really focused on executing our plans. If we compare ourselves to where we were last year, our brands are in a much more pronounced place than they were last year,” he said. “We’ve got stronger brand identities and we’re more practiced in our playbook that we talk a lot about, driving better product, better pricing, more relevance, better consumer experience and excellence in execution.” 

Since Dickson took the helm of Gap a little over a year ago, he’s worked to turn around the business after years of declines. Under his direction, the company has leaned into nostalgic marketing and celebrity partnerships to reclaim cultural relevance. Sales have grown for the last four quarters in a row, but the company is still smaller than it once was, and critics say it needs to do more to fix its product assortment and drive full-price selling.

Here’s a closer look at each brand’s performance: 

**Old Navy:** Gap said sales at its largest brand grew 1% to $2.2 billion, while comparable sales were flat, shy of the 0.9% growth that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Old Navy’s kids category was particularly affected by the warmer weather, said Dickson. 

**Gap:** Gap’s eponymous banner grew 1% to $899 million during the quarter, while comparable sales were up 3% — better than the 2.3% growth Wall Street expected, according to StreetAccount. The brand has seen four straight quarters of positive comparable sales and is benefiting from better marketing and product, the company said. 

**Banana Republic:** The trendy workwear line grew sales 2% to $469 million while comparable sales fell 1%, a bit worse than the 0.8% drop that StreetAccount had expected. The brand has worked to turn around its men’s business, which drove results during the quarter. Overall, it is still focused “on fixing the fundamentals,” the company said. 

**Athleta:** The athleisure arm of Gap’s empire grew sales by 4% to $290 million while comparable sales were up 5%. The results weren’t comparable to estimates. In the year-ago period, comparable sales were down 19% at Athleta. Under its new CEO, former Alo Yoga boss Chris Blakeslee, the brand has managed to turn things around.

stocks,Manchester United stock (NYSE: MANU) – potential to grow,"According to Forbes magazine Manchester United is the second most valuable club in football, only behind Real Madrid. Only Real Madrid and Barcelona have more fans in the world. This is despite the fact that last major trophy they won is Premier League in 2013.  This was the last season with Sir Alex Ferguson at the helm – he is the best manager in history of this club. He retired and since then they are struggling a lot and underperforming. Last season they finished 8^(th) in the Premier League, this season they are 13^(th). Disappointment. They play in Europa League, second tier competition in Europe. The real money is in Champions League.

They have a tremendous potential. Big history, a lot of fans, a lot of money. They should compete for the most important throphies every year. But they didn’t in previous years and fans are angry about that.

Things are subject to change though. At the end of 2023 Sir James Ratcliffe bought 25% of club’s shares. He is the fan of the club and he has a lot to say about how the club is run. He is committed to rebuilding club and bring back glory the club aspire to. On January 2024 Omar Berrada was appointed as new CEO of the club, chief executive officer. He joined United after 13 years spent in Manchester City that was the most successful club in England during this period. On July 2024 Dan Ashworth started to work as sporting director. He worked for Newcastle and Brighton previously. He did a really god job there. In Brighton under his watch they transferred in Caicedo, Mac Allister, Cucurella, Mitoma and Trossard, they sold them later for more money. In Newcastle he was in charged when they bought Isak, Gordon, Barnes, Tonali and Botman. Great business. Recently they hired Ruben Amorim, who was successful in Sporting Lisboa. In the summer he was considered as new Liverpool FC manager, eventually they decided to go with Arne Slot who is excellent in his new role.

The future for Manchester United is bright. They have a competent people running the club. Ruben Amorim is one of the best of young managers in the world and seems to be a really good pick who is able to transform the whole club like Jurgen Klopp did it at Liverpool in the last decade. He needs time but he seems to be capable of making Manchester United great again. They were underperforming in the last 10 years but finally they addressed the issues and should be performing better. They need a time, of course, to build strong team. The thing is – if they perform on the pitch, they earn more money. I believe it is the matter of time before they are on the top. And when they reach this level, when they compete amongst really the best, their stock price should be much higher than it is now.

I think they will be a strong again very soon, they will compete and good performance on the pitch will result with big amount of cash going to the club. The next 10 years should be much better than the last 10 years. Currently their stock price is 17,47 USD. They certainly has potential for more. One more reason is – there are more and more money in football every year so this is another factor in favor of this stock.

I think that this club will compete for Premier League and Champions League in 2-4 years and it should have a huge impact on their finances. My opinion is this stock has potential to grow. Am I wrong? What do you think? I am new in the stock market so maybe I am missing something.",0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gxinau/manchester_united_stock_nyse_manu_potential_to/

*For the quarter in progress, Palo Alto Networks expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $1.54 to $1.56, with a mid-point that matches the estimate. Its revenue projection for the second quarter ranges from $2.22B to $2.25B, which represents 13% growth year over year. The mid-point of $2.235B comes in just above the estimate of $2.23B.*   

*Second quarter Next-Generation Security ARR is expected to range from $4.7B to $4.75B, which would represent a year-over-year increase of 20%.*

*Total revenue for fiscal year 2025, which runs from August 2024 through July 2025, is expected to range from $9.12B to $9.17B. This would represent 14% growth year over year.* 

*""Our platformization progress continued in Q1, driving strong financial results,"" said Dipak Golechha, chief financial officer of Palo Alto Networks. ""As a result, we are raising our NGS ARR, revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year.""*

*The board of directors also approved a two-for-one stock split, which will increase the number of authorized common shares from 1B to 2B. Trading on a split-adjusted basis is expected to begin on Dec. 16, 2024.*

I've been a big fan of PANW for the last 2 years. While the billings decline isn't great, it's been expected as the company pushes for platformization. I anticipate this to be great in the long term outlook, but short term, may seem like growth is slowing. Platformization will make their services sticky and harder for companies to leave because they'll be integrated across the business across multiple levels.

Although I'm a big fan of the stock, I will admit it's an expensive one. A lot hinges on future growth of the whole industry and if there are any signs of slowed growth, I think this one will hurt for investors buying at these levels. I'm not in cybersecurity so I'm not sure the likelihood of that, but I'd keep an eye on it. I've made several posts about PANW over the last year and my consensus is I will continue to buy monthly and if there's a large pull back down to <350 I'll look to make a large purchase with cash reserves.",59,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwgtsd/palo_alto_networks_beats_q1_estimates_shares_fall/
stocks,Adani Group shares nosedive after chairman Gautam Adani charged with fraud in New York,"India’s Adani Group saw shares of its companies plunge Thursday after its billionaire chairman Gautam Adani was indicted in a New York federal court over his alleged involvement in an extensive bribery and fraud operation.

The 62-year-old billionaire and the seven other defendants have been accused of paying over $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to secure solar energy contracts that could generate more than $2 billion in profits.

The Indian group’s flagship firm Adani Enterprises fell 10%, while the company in the eye of the storm Adani Green Energy tanked 17.28%. Adani Energy fell 20%. 

Adani Power lost 13.81%, Adani Port’s share price dropped 10%, while the group’s retail arm Adani Wilmar shed 7.87%.

The benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index slid 0.63% in its first hour of trade.

Adani, along with two executives from Adani Green Energy Limited — his nephew Sagar Adani and Vneet Jaain — have been charged with misleading U.S. and international investors about the company’s adherence to antibribery and anticorruption standards while raising over $3 billion to finance energy projects.

The five-count indictment in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn also accused Ranjit Gupta and Rupesh Agarwal, former executives of the renewable energy firm Azure Power Global, along with three former employees of the Canadian institutional investor Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec — Saurabh Agarwal, Cyril Cabanes, and Deepak Malhotra.

CDPQ said it is aware of the charges filed. “Those employees were all terminated in 2023 and CDPQ is cooperating with U.S. authorities,” the investor said in an email.

This comes after the conglomerate spent the bulk of last year attempting to move beyond the allegations of accounting fraud and “brazen stock manipulation” made by shortseller firm Hindenburg Research. 

“Since releasing our January 2023 report identifying Adani as the largest corporate con in history, we have never wavered in our view, nor has Adani ever refuted our findings,” Hindenburg said in a statement to CNBC on Thursday.

The conglomerate had rebutted the claims, adding that it has “always been in compliance with all laws.”

These charges do not change the “strong underlying fundamentals” of India’s market or the country’s growth trajectory, said Raymond James’ head of advisory solutions and market strategy, Matt Orton. 

“Once the dust settles, there will be even better opportunities for long-term investors in India,” he said.

Then as we would usually see analysts revise their predictions after the market moves (especially if they called it wrong), to make it seem they are smart or something, BOFA securities revised their predictions, to be even more wrong, showing that they are doubling down on their/people-who-listen-to-theirtrading-advice shorts and are willing to be in denial on a stock even if the market decides they are wrong.

stocks,Any investors here looking at European markets ?,"Let me preface this by saying I live in Europe and after dabbling initially in companies closer to home switched to US markets due to higher historical returns.

This in hindsight was an excellent decision as almost all my investments in the S&P/Nasdaq have outperformed the ones listed in Europe. So do any American guys look at European markets and see any opportunity to create alpha or are bullish on the EU markets. 

There’s an argument to be made that potentially investing into EU serves as a way to diversify and lower exposure to US markets. But I find it very hard to find good European companies with solid fundamentals that have good stock performance. Could be a myriad of reasons including liquidity, slower growth, more regulation and government oversight. 

Personally the three companies I still have in my portfolio in the EU markets is RR, NVO and LVMH. LVMH is slowing down but most likely due to luxury market turmoil and exposure to China. Additionally NVO is listed on NYSE and had uptil recently performed rather well.

So finally my question being are any guys actively eschewing the American markets for European ones or actively increasing their allocation, if so would love to know the rationale. And more importantly any particular industries or geographies that you’re targeting? ",42,153,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwgyqv/any_investors_here_looking_at_european_markets/
stocks,Thoughts on building a 10Y high risk portfolio,"Over the past few years I’ve built a portfolio consisting of S&P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK. It has done rather well, consistently giving returns of 25%+ annually (except 2022). 

However in recent times my conviction on adding more capital to this portfolio has waned. I just feel the best days in terms of returns for some of the big tech groups may not be what they were for the past decade.

I could 100% be wrong and there is no doubt there is certain bias seeing the return of my smaller positions this year dwarfing the ones of the traditional blue chip guys if you will.

So saying all this I’m considering: 

50% S&P

10% Hood

10% Rddt

10% Rolls Royce

10% Cava

5% Lunr

5% ASTS

Quick rationale for each:

Hood: Expanding to Europe and offering very exciting new products like Hood Gold 

Rddt: Fastest growing social media, ARPU and monetisation only getting better and seeing many more people using

Rolls Royce: Slight European exposure, building low cost Nuclear plants and capturing the wide body aircraft market

Cava: Fantastic management, strong customer retention and expected to double stores in next 5 years

Lunr & ASTS: Moonshot (literally), this is just in case space works out and much more speculative 



So having said all that, what is everyone’s thoughts on this proposed portfolio allocation. Is this too risky, not enough diversification into the different sectors?

stocks,Class action lawsuits have been raised against ASML - is it frivolous?,"Firstly, apologies for my English, it's not my first language.

My stock broker have sent me several notifications regarding class action lawsuits being levied against ASML after the last earnings report. The following are the ones I am aware of:

**11/20 - Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman LLC.**  
The complaint alleges ASML misrepresentet or failed to disclose that: (1) the issues being faced by suppliers, like ASML, in the semiconductor industry were much more severe than ASML had indicated to investors, (2) the pace of recovery of sales in the semiconductor industry was much slower than Defendants had publicy acknowledged; (3) ASML had created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to anticipated growth, while downplaying risk from macroeconomic and industry fluctiatinos, as well as stronger regulations restricting the export of semiconductor technology.

**11/20 - Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP.**

The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operation and prospects

**11/19 - Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP.**

**11/19 - The Law Offices of Frank R. Cruz**

**11/19 - Law Offices of Howard G. Smith**

**11/19 - Rosen Law Firm**

**11/19 - Pomerantz Law Firm**

**11/19 - Schall Law Firm**

**11/19 - Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman**

Have also done the same with similar allegations raised against ASML. Now, it seemed to me after the earnings report that while it was not exactly a good one, I've never really assumed there was any misleading being done. Sometimes you raise guidance, sometimes you lower guidance. 

  
I assume my broker have an obligation to notify me of all of these class action lawsuits, but I've not really seen any discussion about them on any on the forums or news sites I follow, which makes me suspect this perhaps is not such a big deal? I am however not very knowledgeable on American law regarding these kinds of lawsuits.

It is often recommended that investors just stick to ETFs such as SPY because it is very unlikely a person will out perform it with their own picks. If I am correct SPY has a like a 7%-8% return all time and closer to like 10% or higher in the last couple years. 
Anyway I see S&Ps high income ETF is just under 12% TTM. So does that mean if I have $100,000 I would get $11,950 in dividends a year? Wouldn’t this be higher than the growth and TTM combined SPY has? If so why wouldn’t everyone just invest in this and get 12% dividends a year?

stocks,The Bullish case for OPRA,"With Google under pressure from the DOJ, this looks like a huge potential for Opera. If Google was forced to sell Chrome, this would give smaller browsers, like Opera, a great chance to gain some market share. Also, when you look at browsers, excluding Edge and Firefox, Opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison. They are also one of the only ""browser stocks"" that there are. At least the only one of any substance. 



On the flip side, even if Google ISN'T forced to sell Chrome, then we should see the momentum continue for GOOG.

I’ve been a long term holder of OPRA for this very reason. They have a steady growing base of 350M users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies. I’ve always looked at OPRA as a hedge against GOOG, at least as far as their browser is concerned. It also pays to hold because they have a great divided.

I’ve been a long term holder of GOOG too though. I think both are great companies, but I’m buying both to more or less hedge my bets.

I think OPRA has a strong chance of seeing some gains if DOJ does follow through.

Positions: GOOG: 6 shares OPRA: 100 shares

stocks,How is Viking Therapeutics Inc not a no brainer buy right now?,"After some research, I really beleive this stock is gold:

Viking Therapeutics shared updates on its obesity treatment program for VK2735 at ObesityWeek:

Subjects achieved mean weight loss of up to 8.2% from baseline and 6.8% placebo-adjusted weight loss after 28 days of daily dosing at 100 mg. As far as I am concerned, I believe this is more effective than Mounjaro which demonstrated an average weight loss of approximately 4% of starting body weight after 4 weeks of treatment. 

Also, Oral VK2735 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with 99% of adverse events classified as mild or moderate. The oral option could revolutionize weight loss treatments by offering greater convenience. 

Let’s look at subcutaneous VK2735 Result(or like doses): Weekly subcutaneous injections led to weight reductions of up to 14.7% from baseline. Up to 88% of treated patients achieved ≥10% weight loss, compared to 4% for placebo. Weight loss was progressive throughout the study, with no plateau at 13 weeks.

The obesity drug market is projected to grow to $130 billion by 2030, offering significant upside for VK2735. This is also important because at this size of a market, it can hold many or multiple big players. Analysts also predict Viking could become a takeover target due to its strong pipeline. This would boost the price up to 3 digits.

What’s more! The company also received praise for its liver disease treatment VK2809, which showed positive results in a Phase 2b trial for MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), a serious liver condition affecting 22 million Americans. Reductions in liver fat ranging from 37% to 55% at 52 weeks, with response rates (≥30% reduction) as high as 88%, far exceed typical benchmarks. 

The clinical data reinforce VK2735's potential as a best-in-class obesity treatment with effective weight loss, strong safety, and durability of results. The only reason why the stock hasn’t sky-rocketed is because of fear mongering by market makers in the aftermath of RFK junior, and as far as I’m concerned, diabete and liver diseases will not go away and the desperation I’ve seen for patients to obtain these drug is mad. ",0,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwvb46/how_is_viking_therapeutics_inc_not_a_no_brainer/

Extract: The first vulnerability relates to financial markets, which remain susceptible to sudden, sharp adjustments. While recent high-volatility episodes were short-lived and had only limited impact on the financial system, underlying vulnerabilities make financial markets prone to bouts of volatility in the future. First, record-low equity premia and compressed corporate bond spreads are signs that investors may be underestimating the likelihood and potential impact of adverse scenarios. Second, concentration of equity market capitalisation and earnings among a handful of companies, notably in the United States, has increased greatly in recent years, raising concerns over the possibility of an asset price bubble connected to artificial intelligence. Given how deeply integrated global equity markets are, negative firm-specific or sector-specific surprises could easily spill-over across the borders.",45,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gvls9p/ecb_warning_on_equity_and_sovereign_debt_risk/

stocks,"Qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in PC chip sales by 2029, as company gets traction beyond smartphones","Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029.

Of that amount, roughly $4 billion will come from PC chips, Qualcomm said at its investor day on Tuesday. The chipmaker just introduced PC processors earlier this year, when it released Snapdragon X for Windows devices.

The latest forecast marks an important milestone for Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm’s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales, about 75% of its entire chip business.

Qualcomm also said on Tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175% by 2029 to $8 billion, of which 80% is tied to contracts that have already been secured.

*″*We have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile,” Amon said at the investor event.

Another $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets, a category Qualcomm calls XR. About $4 billion of the forecast is a catch-all for other chip sales, like those for wireless headphones and tablets.

Qualcomm shares are up 16% this year, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 26%.

Qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high-end smartphones, especially those running Google Android. Qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to Apple for its iPhones.

But the company has warned investors that Apple could choose to stop buying Qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. Qualcomm said on Tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from Apple.

Qualcomm’s strategy under Amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips, like modems, processors, and AI accelerators, in new markets, including cars, PCs, and virtual reality. The investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. Qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion.

“We put a strategy in ’21, and we’re not changing our strategy,” Amon said.

Laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by Intel, which has over 70% percent of the market, according to Mercury Research. Intel reported $29 billion in PC chip sales in its 2023.

“The competitive landscape changed between the Windows and Macs,” Amon said, referring to Apple’s move in 2020 to switch from Intel to its own processors. “We saw that as an opportunity, especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution.”

The forecast for XR headsets also hints at the growth potential of the VR market over the next five years. Qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers, including Meta for its Quest and Ray-Bans products.

When it comes to artificial intelligence, Qualcomm calls itself an “edge AI” company, in contrast to cloud-based AI that’s typically powered by Nvidia processors. Company officials didn’t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with CNBC.

Qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced AI that’s restricted to large server farms today, an indication that that company may benefit from the AI boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient.

“What you can run on the cloud last year, you can run on the device this year,” Durga Malladi, Qualcomm’s senior vice president in charge of planning, said at the event.

stocks,"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise value","Hello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value. I recognize that this is /r investing and thus short selling is not within everyone's risk profile. I hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir.

So here’s something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right…?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I’m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o’ business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir’s stock is.

For starters, let’s take into consideration palantir’s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir’s enterprise value has ballooned much more.

*2021 peak enterprise value:* $60B at around $37 per share  
*17/11/2024 enterprise value:* $146B at around $64 per share

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19* 

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this. 

But consider this. In their last “blowout” quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. 

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir’s revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy’s (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It’s not just about justifying the current stock price, it’s about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. 

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It’s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*. 

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it’s an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end. 

As it stands now, *all* of palantir’s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is. 

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!* 

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). The leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time. Thus, I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that’s what makes a market.

stocks,"Sony is in talks to buy Kadokawa, media powerhouse behind 'Elden Ring'","NEW YORK/TOKYO, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Sony (6758.T), opens new tab is in talks to acquire Kadokawa (9468.T), opens new tab, the Japanese media powerhouse behind the “Elden Ring” game, two sources familiar with the matter said, as the technology giant looks to add to its entertainment portfolio.

The talks between the two sides are ongoing and, if successful, a deal could be signed in the coming weeks, the sources said.

Sony already has a 2% stake in Kadokawa and a stake in Kadokawa controlled FromSoftware, the developer of the hit fantasy action role-playing game.

Kadokawa is a huge player in Japan. I would say this is almost the equivalent of Disney buying Fox in the West. They’re not just the parent company behind ‘Elden Ring,’ they’re a anime, manga, light novel, and magazine publisher. They also produce and distribute anime and video games. They also have their hands in the music industry.

stocks,Okta - my analysis and thoughts,"I'd appreciate any and all feedback to see if I feel I'm on track or not and your perspective on my take. I know Okta took the hit after the social engineering ""hack"", but there's no doubt they're still the leader in the IAM space. I believe there's way more upside, but I also realize that they \*could\* be a serious M&A target.

**Executive Investment Summary: Okta, Inc.**

**Overview**

Okta, Inc. is a leading provider of identity and access management (IAM) solutions, serving enterprises globally with secure authentication systems. Its strong revenue growth, cash flow, and leadership in the cybersecurity market make it an attractive acquisition target.



***Key Financial Highlights***

\- Revenue (TTM): $2.45 billion, reflecting 16.2% YoY growth.

\- Profitability:

\- Net Income: -$136 million (improved from -$355 million YoY).

\- EBITDA: -$145 million.

\- Cash Flow Positive: Despite unprofitability, generating $607M in free cash flow.

\- Cash Position: $2.2 billion; current ratio of 1.83 (strong liquidity).

\- Debt Profile: $1.297 billion in total debt; net debt of $820 million (manageable).

\- Market Cap: \~$12–15 billion.

\- Valuation Multiples: Acquisition valuation estimated at $16–18 billion, reflecting 6–9x revenue multiples.



**Strategic Acquisition Rationale**



Market Opportunity

The IAM market is expanding due to hybrid work and zero-trust security models. Okta’s leadership in this high-demand space adds immediate value to acquirers.



Synergies

1. Revenue Synergies:

\- Cross-selling within SaaS, cloud, and cybersecurity ecosystems.

\- Increases customer retention via integrated security offerings.

2. Cost Synergies:

\- Consolidation of R&D, sales, and administrative functions.



**Tax Advantages**

1. Net Operating Losses (NOLs):

\- Okta’s significant NOLs can offset taxable income for the acquirer under U.S. tax rules (IRC Section 382), reducing the acquirer’s overall tax burden.

\- For cash-flow-positive acquirers like *Microsoft* or *Salesforce*, this could be an immediate financial benefit.

2. R&D Tax Credits:

\- Okta’s investment in IAM technology qualifies for R&D tax credits, which the acquirer can leverage to reduce tax liability.

3. Capital Gains Protection:

\- If the acquirer has large realized gains in 2024, purchasing Okta could offset these with acquisition-related costs.



Timing Considerations

2024: Lower valuation; earlier synergies and immediate tax benefits from NOLs.

2025: Higher valuation but lower operational risk as Okta achieves profitability milestones.



**Potential Acquirers and Recommendations**

Acquirer: Microsoft

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Integrates into Azure AD; removes a competitor; strengthens security leadership. Early acquisition maximizes synergies and tax advantages from Okta’s NOLs.



Acquirer: Google (Alphabet)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Conservative M&A approach; IAM complements Google Cloud; may prefer profitability first.



Acquirer: Amazon (AWS)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Less urgent; would act only if Microsoft or others make a move.



Acquirer: Salesforce

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Complements Slack and Salesforce’s SaaS stack; increases enterprise value. Tax advantages can offset acquisition costs while enhancing shareholder value.



Acquirer: Cisco

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Aligns with Cisco’s cybersecurity strategy; enhances subscription revenue growth. Okta’s NOLs can be applied against Cisco’s strong operating profits.



**Valuation and Stock Price Impact**



Acquisition Valuation

2024: $16–18 billion (20–40% premium).

2025: $18–22 billion, assuming profitability.



Stock Price Impact

2024 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $95.81–$107.78 per share.

\- Upside: +29% to +45% (from \~$74.51 current price).



2025 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $107–$130 per share.

\- Upside: +44% to +75%.



**Final Recommendation**



For Acquirers

2024 Acquisition:

\- Microsoft, Salesforce, Cisco: Act now to secure market share, synergies, and tax advantages while Okta is undervalued.



2025 Acquisition:

\- Google, Amazon: Wait for profitability milestones, reducing operational risks.



For Stockholders

Hold the stock for potential 29–75% upside over the next 12–18 months through organic growth or an acquisition.

**Conclusion**

Okta is a prime acquisition target with robust growth potential, strategic synergies, and significant tax advantages for tech giants. While aggressive acquirers like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Cisco should act in 2024 to maximize these benefits, more conservative companies like Google and Amazon may wait until 2025 for improved profitability metrics. Either way, Okta presents a compelling investment with projected stock price increases of $95–$130 per share.

investing,Is crypto just a decentralized pyramid scheme?,"I’ve sold my 11k holdings of Bitcoin today, after someone made a point in one of my friend’s discord servers that kinda spooked me.

The opinion was:

> The issue with decentralized cryptocurrencies is that they are fundamentally, worthless. Bitcoin did not become more desirable between today and yesterday. Nothing has caused that movement other than arbitrary changes in supply and demand. So why does it change in price at all? Because people want to make more REAL money, and holding onto Bitcoin has proven to be a viable approach (until it isn’t). Nobody really wants more Bitcoin, they want more dollars, and they believe that holding onto Bitcoin will get them more money. 

> The theory is that the supply of Bitcoin is finite, meaning it can only go up. This almost makes sense. But this doodle I drew on a paper is also finite, that doesn’t mean it has value. For the theory to make sense, this substance needs to be desirable for reasons that aren’t just “someone will pay more for this in a few years” because what happens when you run out of people that want to buy in. You get stuck with a worthless bag.

> While nobody is directly running a pyramid scheme (with mainstream coins), the idea of how profit is made is similar. To make a profit, you need a continuous stream of buy ins despite offering 0 product. Unlike with a company stock, you are buying part of a functional business that generates a profit or has the potential too. Same for real estate or any other investment. Your purchase may be purely to get more dollars, but there are multiple valuation metrics of stuff like this based on real world revenue and profit potential through real operations.

> Some argue that decentralized crypto will replace government regulated money. No, it never will. Centralized government regulated crypto can be a thing, but a decentralized coin causes various challenges such as taxes (meaning the IRS will never want decentralized crypto adoption), government controlled inflation, and stability. Government administered crypto can be a good substitute to physical currency but it will likely be far too many years before that takes off. It also won’t help mainstream crypto coins.",1922,1927,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h1ifzp/is_crypto_just_a_decentralized_pyramid_scheme/

After 24 months the company will match each employee's amount of shares. Only after 24 months will we be able to sell any shares.

investing,The brokerage Public.c*m is marketing junk bonds as “locked in interest rates” at inexperienced investors. ,"Public.com is a brokerage that is marketed at inexperienced investors looking to invest their money safely. Recently they have been doing a huge ad campaign about “locking in interest rates at 7%” targeted at new investors. 

If you look at what they are selling, it’s basically splitting your money across 10 bonds ranging between not the best issuer rating to junk bonds. Many of these bonds have already have call criteria met (like Tapestry bonds: they were selling them after their merger was blocked which was the call back criteria for the bond).

Many more of these bonds have moderate default risk and high call back risk. Basically they are selling marked up junk bonds as “locked in 7% interest rates” to new investors. With 0.5% fees, plus an additional bond account fee, meaning your real yield is much lower.

investing,Paying off the Mortgage instead of investing for growth ?,"Can someone please explain the focus on paying off the mortgage either as quickly as possible or before retirement?

I’ve bought 4 houses and a vacation condo selling all but the 4th house which I live in and bought 2.5 years ago 

In each case I took out a 30 year mortgage at the best rate available at the time 

My monthly payment ranged from a little over $1,000 to the current $3300

When I sold house #3 after 20 years, I still cleared enough to pay cash for the current house. But, I put down just enough to get a 2.75% mortgage and put the rest into my brokerage account (mostly NVDA & PANL). Now, combined with what was already in the brokerage account and the IRAs, we have a bit over $6M which easily generates over $10k/month - when including social security and small pension is around $20,000/month

I fail to see how we could have acquired this much $ had we accelerated or house payoff

I would like to hear reasoning for paying off the house as my son is asking me for financial advice and I think my system has worked well. Is it a factor of time and luck?

The other thing we are doing that appears to contradict my reading is we are drawing on the IRA money first instead of the brokerage account money. I’m doing this for 2 reasons 1. Keep RMDs (in two more years) from being greater than we need- putting us potentially in higher tax bracket (and Medicare costs) and 2. My son will have to liquidate the inherited IRA within 10 years (more potential taxes) while he can do whatever he wants with stocks at the stepped up basis.  Again, why is this not the generally preferred approach?

investing,Need help understading right issues,"Hey everybody, hope you're doing fine, and happy thanksgiving to those celebrating it!! (Here in Spain we sadly dont)

  
I'm still on the learning stage, and came across the concept of ""right issues"" thought I had understood it properly. However, when I jump to see some up-to date examples on the real market, I got very confused. 

  
So my understanding is that there is a date called ""ex-rights date"" (Correct me if I'm wrong) which is the last date when shareholders can accept the right issue, then after some days-weeks the new shares will jump on the market and the price will adjust to the new volume.

  
So the point here is that as I understand it, there is no profit on buying shares between the ex-rights date and the date when the new shares are introduced, right? Because you are buying shares which will go inevitably go down in price when the price adjust. 

The thing is that I saw the Atos situation, the ex-rights date was 25Nov and the date that the new share will be introduced will be 10 dec +/-, but after 25Nov a lor of people have been buying their shares and I dont understand why because they cant benefit from the right issue and their shares will go down when the new shares are introduced in the market? So, to those looking to invest, wouldnt be more logical to wait till the price adjustment happens and then buy the shares at a lower price? What am I missing here?

investing,My latest greatest savings that every one can try,"I’m not sure how many of you have spent $xx to replace the charging cables for apple products, samsung devices etc. Here is a $2 tip that saves you from buying those $19.99 cables again and again. 

Happy Thanksgiving

I just purchased my iphone 16 pro last weekend. The screen is much improved (the flares are more limited) and the speed of reacting to maneuvering is way faster. An extra cable is again $20 plus tax. 

The sales manager is surprised that I was still using an older model iphone and original charging cable . She asked, is it an iphone 8. I answered it’s an iphone 7. she is surprised. I have literally had the old iphone 7 that lasted 8 years. And I said, it probably would surprise you even more that my old 8 year old charging cable is still working. She said really?

I wanna share my very economical and simple tip. Just use any brand black electric tapes wrap around the white portal where it charges the phone and the joints location of the cable near the white portal and it makes the cable last 3 times longer, tested and proved.   
  
If you have a slightly broken cable that has exposed wires, this tip would save the cable too. I tried this tip on all my charging cables and earphones and they are proved to work.

A roll of black electric tape is $2.",0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h1z50m/my_latest_greatest_savings_that_every_one_can_try/

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024.

investing,"UBS (managed) to Fidelity (self- directed) brokerage account, need advice","I was a saver for a long time and started a fully managed UBS brokerage account 2 years ago, the fees were 1%.  I recently decided to switch my account to Fidelity, to a self manage brokerage account. Everything transferred over smoothly, didn't have t sell anything as there were to proprietary UBS funds. 

UBS made me a really conservative portfolio, that's' my fault because I told them I didn't want to take losses.



I have 2 options with fidelity:



 Option 1: my plan was to go self managed and have a 4 fund portfolio: 60% US total market, 20% international total market, 10% growth and 10% Bonds. The problem is that what was transferred from UBS is a mess of ETFs and asset allocation is really bad with 42% bonds! So obviously I have to rebalance for a more aggressive portfolio. 



Option 2: I have a call next Dec the 2nd with a fidelity advisor about the benefits of going with a fully managed account (they're the ones who called me and I agreed to listen to them), the highlights are fees of 0.3- 0.7%, and tax loss harvesting. He said that with what with they can save me with tax loss harvesting, etc, they can beat the market by 1%, but i don't if I believe that.



Questions:

If I go with option 1, based on my positions (attached), would I have to sell a lot and buy the funds I want and create a big tax event? Or can  trade ETFs so I don't take big tax hit? My first step is to convert about 32% of my bonds to stocks. Would rebalancing be a panfull prcess? is my 4 fund portfolio plan okay?: 60% US total market, 20% international total market, 10% growth and 10% Bonds. Any recommendations? I think I can ride a stock market downturn, hopefully (see numbers below).

Or should I go with option 2 (fully managed account) and tell them to go aggressive a let them do their thing? Would  this be more beneficial in my case? 



Some context that can help with answering questions:

\- $550k portfolio, I max out 401K and Roth IRA every year, will contribute to the rest to brokerage account every paycheck. 

\-  $30k emergency fund, Only debt is $800 a month mortgage (60k balance). I'm not a big spender.

\- 40y/o, thinking about retiring at 55, I currently have $300k (in 401k and Roth IRA). $120Kk salary.

investing,Self-Employed Retirement and Tax Strategies: Where Should I Start?,"Hi everyone,

I've been diving into way too many YouTube videos a lot of (Mark J. Kohler’s channel) about where to start putting retirement funds as a self-employed individual, with an overload of information I don't know if I'm any further with my knowledge. 

Here’s my situation:

* I just turned 34 and have been running my own business for six years.
* For the first five years, I made heavy equipment purchases that provided significant tax deductions, leaving little room to contribute to retirement. Excess cash was reinvested into scaling the business.
* In 2024, I no longer have those large write-offs and don’t foresee major purchases for a while. As a result, my tax bill is projected to be $35-40k this year.
* I roughly have $40K today that I would put toward retirement. 

# Steps I’ve Looked Into So Far:

1. **HSA (Health Savings Account):**
   * I wish I’d started this sooner.
   * I currently have a marketplace PPO plan but wanted to switch to a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) for December to use the “last month rule” and make a 2024 HSA contribution. Unfortunately, I learned this requires a qualifying life event to change plans outside open enrollment, so my HDHP won’t begin until January 2025.
   * I plan to max out the $4,300 contribution for 2025, but this won’t help reduce my 2024 tax burden.
2. **Solo 401(k):**
   * This seems like a logical next step to reduce taxes and begin building retirement savings.

# Additional Notes:

* I haven’t set up an S-corp yet. The main reason is that I’m planning to build a garage-house in 2026 and want to avoid complicating my tax returns for loan qualification. Once the loan is secured, I’ll likely switch to an S-corp.

# My Questions for You:

1. What would you prioritize to maximize tax savings and begin retirement funding for 2024?
2. Are there other strategies or accounts (besides an HSA and Solo 401(k)) that I should be considering?

investing,Bitcoin Created a Paradox,"Bitcoin was engineered to solve a specific problem: creating a non-inflationary currency free from centralized control. But there's a fascinating paradox at its core that I haven't seen discussed enough.

**The Paradox**

Traditional stores of value (like gold) became valuable because they were naturally stable. Bitcoin is trying to do this backwards - it was engineered to be a store of value before achieving stability. Here's the problem: a currency needs stability to be useful, but Bitcoin won't stabilize until it's widely used.

This creates a chicken-and-egg problem:
- People won't use it as a currency until it's stable
- It won't stabilize until there's widespread usage
- But widespread usage requires stability...

**The Investment Case**

When you buy Bitcoin, you're betting on it eventually solving this stability paradox. If it succeeds in becoming the global store of value, the upside is massive. Consider what capturing even a fraction of these markets would mean:
- Global gold market ($12.5T)
- Government forex reserves ($12T)
- Institutional treasury reserves
- Corporate balance sheets
- Sovereign wealth funds

investing,Is MicroStrategy’s Strategy Innovative Financial Engineering or Something Riskier?,"I’ve been digging into **MicroStrategy** (Ticker: MSTR) and its bold strategy of going all-in on Bitcoin—positioning themselves as a “Bitcoin proxy.” They’ve adopted a pure-play approach, using billions in low-interest convertible bonds (sometimes at 0%) to fund [massive Bitcoin acquisitions](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microstrategy-makes-record-breaking-bitcoin-084042808.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAITnZfmYGc_hWsrAN9TW9btBfpMrT9l2sRgYV8tpd7i45PIcC4TW-MJ3ueqnXfglWEfcmQcNnQ15Qmb7BuliSKOkcsKRCHddLb-Suzh5O4HYTg-smdaf-cAKHFWuvsJheahdS1ymmBC5ZPgNZSba489qkPOS17jX9j3lV_8aJzuk).

From what I understand, MicroStrategy sells stock volatility to convertible bondholders, who profit from the “Gamma game.” Meanwhile, retail shareholders often see it as a straightforward Bitcoin play, which seems to leave them exposed to significant downside risks, like dilution and price drops. Bondholders, on the other hand, are protected with senior claims and hedged positions.

I’m curious to hear your thoughts:

1. Could this model collapse if Bitcoin’s price or market volatility drops significantly, given its reliance on continuous capital inflows?
2. Do you see this as a clever piece of financial engineering—or is it closer to something riskier, perhaps a pyramid scheme....?

For context, I’ve looked into a few sources that break this down in more detail:

* **Michael Saylor on Valuetainment (PBD Podcast)**: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n53qmZ84zC0&ab_channel=Valuetainment)

investing,Momentum funds in a bear market,"Momentum funds like SPMO are great in a bull market, but are often looked down upon for their higher risk with a market correction. However, in 2022 we saw that SPMO did not go down as much as the S&P500. I didn’t pay attention to the fund at the time, but it must have rotated into more defensive holdings during the downturn.

So, in theory would a momentum strategy still be viable during a bear market due to its ability to rotate into better performing stocks (more defensive/value stocks)?

investing,Confused about when to take profits,"So this does get a bit into the conversation of ""timing the markets"" which there is never a right way to do that.  

I currently have a chunk of my Roth IRA in FBTC (Fidelity Bitcoin Fund). I took advantage years ago in getting into GBTC (prior to the SEC ETF approvals). After the approvals, I ended up selling (at a tiny loss) the GBTC and moved those funds into FBTC, probably $14k worth, when it was around $35.  I've since weekly contributed to it and my avg basis is around $44.  FBTC is currently trading around $83 due to BTC hovering around $95k.  I am long on BTC, however I am currently up around 88%.  I have a smaller amount in MSTR with an avg basis of $100, and that is up over 250%.  

I've read before ""take out your initial investment to freeze profits"".  So in my FBTC scenario, does that mean when I feel like pulling the trigger I'd pull out $14k...under the assumption I think  there will be a pullback at some point..in which case I'd buy in at the lower amount (let's say $70-75 ish). 

So this sounds like it would raise my cost basis from $44 to probably near 70, yes? I'm just trying to understand the appropriate way one should 'take profit' when it comes to investing.

I followed a strict buy and hold strategy up until now, but wanted to spice things up a little by introducing swing trades with a small % of my portfolio. As I read through various strategies and derivatives, something came up my mind and I wanted to see if my logic is flawed here.

The idea of swing trade was made with limit buys and limit sells. But as time went on, I read about options, specifically writing options. So now, instead of using limit sells and limit buys, isn't it obviously better to write cash secured puts and covered calls options with the anyway desired strike price? This way, you get the same strike price as a limit order, but as long as the strike is not met, you earn premium.

Is there any flaw to this logic? Am I overlooking something?

Most of them were going downhill until then, but then they collectively went up really fast, even though at the same time we saw the largest plunge in the stock market in two years. Why is that?

United: 34,61 to 92,40€ (+166%)  
Delta: 32,45 to 62,44€ (+92%)  
American: 8,37 to 14,22€ (+69%)  
Southwest: 21,91 to 31,19€ (+42%)

Quantas 3,42 to 5,45 (+59%)  
RyanAir 13,60 to 18,59€ (+36%)  
EasyJet  4,80 to 6,40 (+33%)
  
Of course I have googled this, but couldn't find a good answer. A Forbes article believes that it's because of lower fuel prices, but is that enough for those massive gains? And why are there some major airlines that aren't doing well at all, like Lufthansa, KLM (Air France) and of course Spirit? Fuel Prices should help all of them equally.  
I also read, that it's because of Trump's re-election, because he wants to loosen regulations. But that wasn't in August, so that doesn't make much sense either.

investing,Question AEG Model vs Residual Earning Model,"Dear Community,

I'm actually working on Penman's Financial Statement Analysis and Security Valuation (self-study) on the Residual Income Model and the AEG Model.

I think I understood the Residual Earning Model well enough to use for my own Valuation pruposes, but the AEG Model is giving me some sort of confusion, especially when i compare the calculated values of both models in comparison.

In one drill exercise i have to calculate the AEG and Residual Earnings for IBM using the following data:

Required Rate of Return: 10%

Book Value of 2010: 18.77 $/share

2011:

Earnings per Share: 13.22$  
Dividend per Share: 3$

2012:

Earnings per Share: 14.61$  
Dividend per Share: 3.3$

After that the growth will be 11% for both the EPS and DPS in the next 3 years..

When i calculate everything I receive the following data:

Residual Earnings: 2011: 11.34 $/share

Residual Earnings: 2012: 11.71 $/share

Residual Earnings: 2013: 12.19 $/share

Residual Earnings: 2014: 12.71 $/share

Residual Earnings: 2011: 13.3 $/share

AEG 2012: 0.368

AEG 2013: 0.479

AEG 2014: 0.524

AEG 2015: 0.587

So i can actually prove, that the change in residual earnings equal the difference in AEG.

But when i calculate the intrinsic value things get confusing for me.

In both Valuation-Models i would discount the calculated numbers accordingly by (1+0.1)\[t\] and add the value with either Book Value of 2010 for Residual Earnings or with EPS of 2011 for the AEG Model.

The last thing i have to do is divide the result of the equation in the AEG model by the capitalization rate of r to get my value per share.

I double checked my calculations and got a valuation of 58.37 with Residual Earnings and of 147.45 with the AEG Model. I know, that actually I havent used a continuing Value for both models, but this shouldnt explain the huge difference based on these numbers. Did I do a mistake in my calculations or in the formula or what do I miss?

I hope someone may be able to help me.",4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h0ne4x/question_aeg_model_vs_residual_earning_model/

These companies provide either uranium material or nuclear component to build nuclear power plants which seem to be demanded significantly in this period.

investing,Looking for Advice: Which REITs are best? REITs vs Physical Real Estate?,"I am looking to diversify my portfolio to have some real estate. I currently have the most shares of REIT, then AGNC, then GOOD. What are your thoughts on these 3 REITs? Are there other ones you would suggest investing in?

As for physical real estate, do you think it’s worth it, for example, to save up $135k for a downpayment in a HYSA versus investing that $135k in the market (mostly into ETFs like QQQM, VTI, & SCHD)? I was discussing with my partner if we should start trying to save for a down payment, but I feel like $135k invested in the market is a serious game changer for growth, so I definitely see pros & cons. Cons with physical real estate also come with management portion, but a pro could be a home we would be able to move into in the future (we have really cheap rent now so not interested in moving now, but idea is to own a home & rent it out for now as investment & potentially move in in the future).",1,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h0ecyu/looking_for_advice_which_reits_are_best_reits_vs/

investing,"Climate Change Investment Strategy
","# Investment Thesis

This portfolio strategy aims to hedge some climate change risks by investing in sectors that will benefit to some extent from climate change. Thematically it's one of the most impactful changes across the next century for human civilization. I believe each year certain allocations will beat the market but overall I do not believe this will beat a S&P 500 ETF. To me this is a set it and forget it portfolio (my main portfolio is involved in high risk trading and I’m transferring some gains here then rebalancing with a slightly higher weighting on positions that are most undervalued). Some defensive sectors align with benefiting from climate change (utilities, consumer staples & defense tech) so this adds to the hedge component. Take from this what you will, overall I believe most people will benefit more from a market etf. Also feel free to roast this portfolio, I put this together in 2 hours, and still need to improve it quite a bit. 

The approach involves:

* Equal-weight allocation across ten key categories (around 10% each)
* Total portfolio allocation: 10% of total assets
* SPUU 13% as Performance Benchmark
* Investment horizon: 30+ years
* Strategy: Dollar-cost averaging profits into positions
* Focus: Major climate change impacts 

# Key Climate Change Drivers

* Increased global temperatures
* Increased utility energy demand
* Increased need for water technologies 
* Increased frequency and severity of fires
* Increased flooding and rising sea levels
* Increased infrastructure rebuilding and increased urban infrastructure
* Increased migration patterns
* Increased resource competition and potential conflicts 
* Increased need for agricultural inputs (ie fertilizer), increased agricultural production in Northern countries (Canada for example)
* Higher Inflationary environments, higher prices for materials
* Increased profits for insurance companies with higher pricing

-is this as simple as it sounds, or are there other components to this strategy?

-I thiiiink I remember that these funds are scheduled on maturity (6-12 month terms?). Correct me if I’m wrong. How would I get (hopefully grown) money out of the fund, and what are the tax implications? 

-is this one of those things that only works with large holdings? Like the transaction/mgmt/whatever other fees and tax burden of gains on a $1k investment isn’t worth the trouble but gains would outweigh tax from a $10k investment? (For example, probably a poorly-explained one at that, but I hope I’m being clear enough…)

investing,What is your investment strategy for your HSA in particular?,"HSA's are a very specific type of investment vehicle that its intended use case is almost entirely for medical expenses. As such, that makes it a very different vehicle than an IRA, 401k, traditional brokerage acct, etc., because unlike those options (that technically can be used for much more than just medical moreso than an HSA tends to) they are primarily for retirement **AND NOT** just for medical expenses.

That is a significant note to take note of  because say you're FIRE, want to use a portion for a house, want to roll money in from a former employer etc. You are **locked into** primarily **just** medical expenses which is the most unpredictable thing out there. Especially if younger. The real reason I'm asking is that unlike retirement, HSA's may have more immediate use cases. Especially with a family. As such, putting your funds into longer term investments sounds like a huge no go. However, plenty of people have said they still put the money in the longer term investments.

Now, you have the option of course just paying out of pocket in order to not touch the HSA, but if you do so you basically lock in not being able to touch your money without penalty until you're 65+(?) I believe. So while sure great ""triple tax advantage,"" but good luck touching that for that to matter until 65+. My initial thoughts have always been to keep it in short term investments like SGOV, USFR, etc. so I have it on hand for medical expenses and can even pay with a cc and reimburse myself from the HSA. 

I have, however, in the back of my head, thought ""I could instead use this for extra tax advantaged ""retirement savings,"" but since I'm an early retirement guy it flusters me to have to wait until 65+ to use money. I try to keep my options more fluid for access. What is your thinking on this for yourself? Do you keep it in short term investments? Do you go long term? A mix? Of course, folks who are sick constantly (God bless you and I wish you speedy recoveries) will probably adjust accordingly, but I'm curious of the general population's mindset on HSA investment?

wallstreetbets,$HIMS is about to get absolutely wrecked. ,"Meta is about to announce a major change to their advertising policies that will decimate HIMS ability to efficiently acquire customers via their most critical channel: Facebook and Instagram Ads.

This is because Meta will be restricting brands like HIMS from using purchase-optimized campaigns, which many are speculating is due to legal liabilities associated with HIPAA violations and the use of the Facebook Pixel, the essential ingredient to running the most profitable type of Facebook ad campaigns.

How do I know this? I run an agency that specializes in Facebook ads and I can tell you this is every FB/IG advertiser's worst nightmare. I would be in a total panic if this was happening to me.

I’ve tested running ads without purchase optimization over many years and I can tell you they are absolute dog shit for getting an ROI. Full stop.

Back to HIMS.

They are especially fucked because:

1. They have a client/patient portal that is subject to strict HIPAA requirements. These advertisers are being specifically targeted by this change.
2. They are overly reliant on Meta ads like many direct to consumer brands. Losing the ability to leverage the best optimization settings will be catastrophic to HIMS customer acquisition cost on day 1.

These changes are going into effect on January 1 and Meta is expected to officially announce it on December 5th. 

If HIMS doesn’t immediately take a hit upon this being announced then I see their Q1-Q2 earnings to look like a flatline after what will likely be their biggest Q4 ever.

wallstreetbets,Where are future returns even supposed to come from? ,"Happy thanksgiving to all of you, I hope you are able to spend time with your loved ones. Just some discussion points about overall valuations in the equity markets. 

This is something that I have wondered for a while. Almost every asset under the sun has skyrocketed, and obviously people are planning to get a return on their investment, so let's discuss how this is even supposed to happen at this point. 

First, there's the low hanging fruit in terms of arguments supporting that we are in a wildly overvalued equity bubble. Dogecoin is worth more than Nintendo. Palantir trades at nearly 60x revenue and made a nanopenny of earnings on a market cap that is nearing ASML's. Tesla is worth $1.1T and thus somehow larger than berkshire. Carvana. I'm not even going to talk about bitcoin. These are prime examples of rampant market speculation and I believe nobody who has their two brain halves connected would argue that these are not cult assets that are disconnected from reality. 

But digging a bit deeper, the bubble doesn't remotely seem to be isolated to certain sectors. Apple is a lick away from 40x earnings. Walmart trades at nearly 40x earnings. Costco somehow manages to sell at nearly 60x earnings. Eli Lilly commands an 85x multiple as an entry price. ServiceNow trades at nearly 175x GAAP eps. These aren't 2021-style ARKK stocks but the largest companies in the world. 

Nvidia is probably the greatest financial success story of all time but they too quickly need to find another $80 billion of annual earnings somewhere otherwise they will also eventually implode like a neutron star. And all of that is happening while the 10-year yields close to 4.5%!

I mean, I like walmart and I like costco. They are good companies. It's a sticky business and they have carved out a nice piece of the U.S. economy for themselves. But Walmart does nearly $700b in revenue and has 3% operating margins. The current EPS yield is barely 2.5%. What is supposed to happen here? Earnings isnt expected to skyrocket and that multiple is so stretched that even 10% yearly EPS growth may leave bulls without a return until 2034. Never, even in my fever dreams, would I have believed that a company like costco would command a 60x premium. 

It seems to me that nearly any asset imaginable is wildly overbought and that people are just pouring they paychecks into the stock market because it has a history of only going up and to the right. But multiples are arguably way ahead of themselves. Current CAPE-ratio has only been higher during two times in history: 1929 and the dotcom bubble. This is kind of a cliché but at the same time, owning these stocks nets you nearly nothing. So what's the game here? Are people betting that Costco will trade at 80x earnings next year? 

Everything I know as a value investor tells me that this must end and that it is time to hedge. But at the same time, anyone who has shorted this ridiculous market has been ground to a pulp by the onslaught of endless liquidity that's pouring into the market. 

So what do you guys think? Are the U.S. stock markets about to pull a Nikkei and leave us all grinding our teeth until 2040 before a new high will be set? Hope that turkey tastes well by the way.

wallstreetbets," NVDA's stock is down 10% in a week, is he still worth following?","NVIDIA reported impressive earnings, with quarterly revenues reaching $35 billion, up 94% year-over-year, with even stronger growth in the data center business, up 112%. Net income doubled to $20 billion and the company showed a strong outlook for future quarters, slightly exceeding market expectations. However, while growth remains impressive, fourth-quarter expected revenue of $37.5 billion is growing at a slower pace, well below the strong growth seen in previous quarters (122%, 262%, 265%). Since then, market concerns about a possible trade war in China have intensified, causing shares to fall

Despite the slowing growth concerns, analysts believe NVIDIA's fundamentals remain solid. The company's dominant position in artificial intelligence and its production capacity constraints mean that it still has plenty of room to grow its revenues. The stock is expected to reach $170 in the next three months. However, while NVIDIA still has investment potential, a number of other AI stocks could offer higher returns in the shorter term and are worth keeping an eye on. If you're looking for an AI stock that's more promising than NVDA but trades for less than 5x its earnings we can talk to each other

The above is my personal opinion please don't disturb WSB order",38,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h21cl3/nvdas_stock_is_down_10_in_a_week_is_he_still/
wallstreetbets,"Good Buying Opportunity After NVDA Pullback
","First of all, I'd like to wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving, and in the midst of today's market break I'd like to share some of my analysis on NVDA

NVIDIA recently reported strong earnings, but the stock pulled back on profit retrenchment. Nonetheless, I think this may provide a buying opportunity for investors

AI growth logic remains strong

NVIDIA's dominant position in data centers allows it to benefit from the $1 trillion wave of global AI infrastructure investment. Despite increased skepticism about the potential for AI expansion, company management remains confident in the demand for AI chips, with the CFO stating that demand for next-generation Blackwell chips is “phenomenal” and that large customers show no signs of slowing their drive to invest in AI

Short-term challenges and long-term potential

In the short term, NVIDIA may face supply constraints and margin dilution, but these issues are seen as temporary. Although the growth rate is slowing down due to the “law of large numbers”, long-term demand is expected to continue to grow with the advancement of enterprise AI and sovereign AI

Technical trends and investment recommendations

From a technical perspective, NVIDIA is in an overall uptrend and the current pullback has not created a clear bearish reversal. I believe that the volatility in the stock price provides a good opportunity to add to a position on the pullback. NVIDIA's forward-looking PEG ratio is below the industry median, indicating that its valuation remains attractive

While volatility is likely to continue in the short term, NVIDIA's leadership in AI and long-term growth potential make it a noteworthy investment target

wallstreetbets,I have reasons to believe that Recursion (RXRX) will became quite popular in the next month.,"I believe that in the future, drugs will be highly customisable based on the patience’s health history. Based on your mass, weight, syndromes, and genetics, you may receive a drug that is well-suited for you and only you. 

How can you do that? First and foremost, you need data, huge amounts of it. We all know how generative and predictive models had advanced in the last year. It wasn’t in fact, until the launch of AlphaFold (by Google, whose team was recently awarded with the Chemistry Nobel Prize), that AI drug discovery became prominent. This open source model is used for molecular discovery. Again, would be nice if a company could:

1. Generate proprietary synthetic, good quality molecular data using models like AlphaFold.
2. Using this data to train models for drug discovery, reducing pipelines costs and times up to 50%.
3. Eventually, with the possibility of bringing the first AI-aided drug to the market.

First two points have been achieved, and the company is Recursion. We may know them because NVIDIA invested 50m in them. Why then are at ATL? I think the answer is time. We all know there is no room for patience when it comes to money sometimes. Training and bringing such results may take years.

However, I think another catalyst is coming. On 9. December, they will host a seminar for new readouts in one of their most well-known drugs in development, CDK7, for advance solid tumours (an inhibitor, which are currently none approved by the FDA).

Now, I am not saying that they will cure cancer - that’s BS. But over the years converging to novel oncological solutions using AI? This is not the only drug they have (other 9 are in development).

They have more than 60 petabytes of data.
They combined forces with Exscientia recently, forming probably the most important powerhouse of AI-drug research.
They are extremely active in the research field (see their presence in the upcoming NeuRIPS conference) or their new open dataset for Quantum Computing (OpenQDC).

I started investing in IONQ in 2021 for a similar impression. Now I am getting the same vibes with this. I feel that a small catalyst will put this to fly, although the real potencial will come in the next 5-10 years. If they can bring the first AI drug to the market,  this implodes.

I need help though putting together what I believe will be the ultimate payday plan if it all goes the way I believe it will.

I believe Bitcoin goes to at least $150,000 a coin this run, and most likely by May of 2025. The play I want to make is calls or longs on MicroStrategy ($MSTR) until the end of April of 2025, and then I want to reverse my position into puts or shorts to ride it all the way down when Bitcoin does its highly predictable cycle nosedive.

At this point, I'm not sure how MicroStrategy will do, because if Bitcoin loses its normal 50 to 80 percent, how does MicroStrategy justify itself until the next cryptocurrency cycle at some point in 2028 or 2029?

They do have 0% interest loans, so maybe nothing significant happens to them, because eventually Bitcoin always goes up and up, so maybe this play can be rinsed and repeated forever.

What do you think, and what plays are you going into tomorrow with?

wallstreetbets,Why NVDA is about to take off after taking a beating (technically speaking),"NVDA has been a kick in the ass lately. I'm holding 500 shares @ $142.25 and a bunch of calls at various dates and prices. 

I identified 3 support levels from June through September, 2 of which have been broken. The next stop is $131-ish IMO. 

Why? This level has been tested twice before and this will be the third time. The other 2 support levels have been tested 0-1 times and we're squashed like bugs. This level has more validity behind it.

In addition, the 9 RSI on the 60min chart (at the time of this writing) reads 22, which implies a stock that got the shit kicked out of it. On the daily, it's a 34. I thought this stock is in an uptrend, wild it got here. And this stock is NVDA, not to be played like a cuck. Real chutzpah it's all the way down here, if you ask me.

I think we will see a serious bounce back to test 150 over 2 weeks, which I base on absolutely nothing. But it's like a rubber band that you stretch so much that it will snap into your eye.

I would not be buying puts at this level, I'd be buying SHARES, or calls, and take a little short term heat for a big payout.

And why did I not wait to buy at this prices instead of buying at $142? 

Bc I'm an idiot and made an impulsive trade. You can't time the top or bottom and I have no doubt it will come back. But how far do I want my ass stretched to get there? 

A question we all must ask ourselves.

Good day to you all

wallstreetbets,$OKLO is Undervalued Relative to $SMR,"It’s mind-boggling that Oklo trades at **\~37%** of NuScale’s market cap ($2.6B vs $6.9B). I strongly believe this valuation disparity will eventually correct. For context, if Oklo were valued similarly to NuScale, its share price could exceed **$58/share**.

Oklo is positioned to lead the domestic nuclear sector;

* Capital Efficiency: arguably the healthiest balance sheet amongst SMR projects, having enough cash on hand to fund through their initial builds, with a low burn rate.
* Strong Leadership: executive leadership team with PhDs, Sam Altman as chairman, and a current board member slated to lead the Energy sector (Chris Wright.) Jake and Caroline (founders) are extremely passionate about the technology and opportunity, signaling to investors that they are keeping their equity for the long haul.
* Proven Technology: EBR-II operated through decades of testing between 1964-1994 at INL, clearly demonstrating that the molten sodium fast reactor can operate reliably and efficiently overtime.
* First-mover Advantage: Aurora is on target towards 2027 deployment at INL. Oklo has had the most regulatory engagement relative to other advanced reactor projects and have hired on a lot of former NRC regulatory staff. Also, unlike their competitors, they’ve already secured fuel from the DOE for their first Aurora build.
* Commercialization Model: their ‘owner and operator’ model will allow them to scale rapidly and profitably alongside AI data centers throughout the 2030s. NRC whitepapers suggested that subsequent site reviews will take as little as 7 months, and Oklo will be able to debt finance project builds through future projected cash flows. They currently have 2.1GW in customer commitments, most notably from Equinix and Wyoming hyperscale.
* Alternative Revenue Streams: Oklo has positioned itself to benefit from other revenue sources; uranium recycling to repurpose fuel from nuclear waste reserves, and the manufacturing of radioisotopes through the recently proposed acquisition of Atomic Alchemy.

In contrast, NuScale is in a much worse position with regard to timelines:

* NuScale doesn’t have any construction or operating licenses, they only have a design certification for their 12x50MW plant. In order for their customers to obtain those licenses, it requires a 24-36 month NRC review period that **has not been initiated yet**. This is why NuScale was projecting their first builds in early 2030s, which is years behind Oklo’s 2027 target and that’s probably being optimistic (as you’ll see below).
* The reason why OKLO is so much further ahead is because they are submitting a COLA, which seeks approval for design, construction and operating, only taking them 24 months. Compare this to NuScale, where **every individual customer** needs to create and submit detailed plans, then wait 24-36 months for build and operating licenses.
* It was a strategic choice by NuScale and others to only sell designs and not be an ‘owner and operator’ like Oklo. They would have to commit to the responsibility of building and running the reactors themselves, which does come with additional hurdles and liability, but allows for **much faster** scaling.
* Putting aside those timelines, Nuscale’s 12x50MW plant was found to be **not economically viable**, so they are back to get a standard design approval for their 6x77MW plant. Considering this factor along with the licensing timelines, their 6x77MW will likely take until 2033 for customer deployment.

Looking ahead, there is significant potential for an OpenAl partnership to materialize in the wake of all the demand that we've been seeing. Sam Altman recently visited DC to pitch lawmakers on the need for multiple 5GW data centers and pushed for the NRC to further streamline SMR approvals to meet those needs. If Oklo would be able to supply just a fraction OpenAl's future energy consumption, that would translate to a massive recurring revenue stream. Combine this with the fact that they are entering a more friendly regulatory environment, especially with Chris Wright heading the DOE under the Trump administration.

**TLDR:** $SMR is far behind $OKLO in licensing timelines (by as much as 6+ years) and it does not appear to be reflected in the market. Aside from the obvious timeline advantage, Oklo stands to benefit from their capital efficiency, leadership team, first-mover advantage, commercialization model, and diversified revenue mix. If Oklo was trading at NuScale’s valuation (which I see as realistic), we’d be looking at over **$58/share**.",111,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h19806/oklo_is_undervalued_relative_to_smr/

wallstreetbets,Why $SPY is the Real Thanksgiving Turkey 🦃,"Alright degenerates, gather round the table because I’ve cooked up some sweet Thanksgiving DD, and no, it’s not cranberry sauce (but this could be just as saucy). Here’s the deal: Thanksgiving isn’t just about stuffing your face and awkwardly dodging Aunt Karen’s questions about why you’re ""still single""—it’s also PRIME TIME for unsolicited stock and crypto pitches at family dinners. And that, my friends, is why Black Friday is not just for TVs at 80% off, but also for **stupidly green markets.**

Here’s how it works:

1. **Family Financial Influencers™:** Grandpa brings up how he’s *still* holding Exxon since the 80s, your cousin Chad flexes his crypto portfolio (which is 90% down, but whatever), and your tech-savvy niece just learned about AI stocks and is suddenly Jim Cramer. Everyone at the table is buzzing with ""hot picks"" while passing the mashed potatoes. This is not financial advice… but it kinda is.
2. **The FOMO Catalyst:** Uncle Bob hears about ""some stock with a weird ticker"" (it’s ACHR, Bob, get with it) and thinks, “Why the hell am I not in this?” By the time the pumpkin pie rolls around, he’s downloading Robinhood. Multiply Uncle Bobs across America, and boom, retail frenzy ensues Friday morning.
3. **Markets are Closed Thursday:** This is key. People have 24 whole hours to stew in their newfound *knowledge*. By the time the market opens Friday, all that pent-up Thanksgiving YOLO energy explodes into buying pressure. Everyone’s a financial genius after 3 glasses of wine and a turkey coma.
4. **Black Friday Greenery:** You know how everyone shops like maniacs on Black Friday? Stocks are no different. This is the ""stock market doorbuster effect."" Everyone's piling into stocks like they’re $5 air fryers. And best of all, it’s also the gateway to the “Santa Claus rally.” As Christmas shopping kicks off, so might the stock market's annual tradition of going full holiday cheer mode. It’s like the market whispering, “You’ve been good this year, here’s a little green to celebrate.” 🎅📈

# My Prediction for Friday:

* **$SPY** opens green (duh): Like your drunk uncle's karaoke rendition of ""Sweet Caroline,"" it’s inevitable.
* **Tech stocks?** Probably up because Aunt Susan heard about AI once on The Today Show and now thinks it’s the key to immortality (it is).
* **Crypto?** Let’s be real—Cousin Chad is hyping Bitcoin like he’s got Satoshi on speed dial. It’s probably gonna pump harder than Grandma’s blood pressure when she finds out you brought store-bought pie.
* **Random meme stocks?** Oh yeah, because someone’s cousin brought up “that one company with the short interest that shall not be mentioned.”
* **ACHR?** $ACHR will be taking a flight (literally and figuratively) this Friday—WSB's favorite bird is ready to soar, and you degenerates are gonna love it. 🚁💸

**TL;DR:** Thanksgiving isn’t just about turkey—it’s a breeding ground for half-baked stock ideas. When Friday rolls around, we’re gonna see a tsunami of retail money hit the markets. $SPY gonna pop, and we’ll all be riding the gravy train. **To the moon or the Wendy's dumpster, GODSPEED** 🫡

*Disclaimer:* This is absolutely NOT financial advice—just a turkey-fueled theory for entertainment purposes only. If it somehow works, consider sharing some pumpkin pie and maybe a thank-you card. 🚀

wallstreetbets,NVDA is about to take off (technically speaking): why I feel more confident following my previous post ,"Greetings,

I hope everyone is getting ready to talk stocks and politics at the Thanksgiving table because that's what the holiday is all about, amiright?

I for one will be talking about NVDA.

I posted earlier today around 10am-11am EST and said that NVDA was gonna stop sliding at 131-ish, since there is a good support there.

And what happened???? The turkey came home to roast

Yes, that's right - it snapped back like a rubber band into your eye. Ok, so that means that the support level that I suggested held for a 3rd time, making it very reliable.

And to add some sugar to that sweet potato pie, the stock closed up $3 from the low and a bullish pattern formed throughout the whole day - the cup and handle (""C+H"").

If you don't know what the C+H pattern looks like, go to your mom's breakfront where she keeps all the tchotchkes and the fine china and take out a tea cup. Hold it up and look at it from the side, with the cup's handle on the right side. Then look at the screenshots I uploaded. It's the same thing.

This mean stock go up.

Interesting how NVDA held at that support level and then the entire day formed a C+H pattern... Hmmm... 

Smells bullish, that's the vibe.

PLUG Power's revenue has been growing fast over the past few years. In their most recent quarter, they reported $260 million in revenue, which is a huge jump compared to where they were just a year ago. This shows that their hydrogen tech is really starting to take off, and they're making big strides in building up their customer base.

What's even better is their gross profit is improving too. They've gone from some pretty hefty losses in the past to now getting closer to break-even. That means they're really starting to scale up. They’ve been investing heavily in R&D and infrastructure, but those costs should start paying off soon.

And here’s the kicker—PLUG is locking down major partnerships and contracts with huge players like Amazon, Walmart, and Home Depot.

1: PLUG looking to get a $1.8ish billion loan from the government

wallstreetbets,ERJ - This stock is challenging two behemoths and I like their chances,"This is obviously not financial advice. I just like the stock and I want to talk about it.

Embraer recently hit it's highest price in the last 10 years and it comes after a disastrous failed merger with Boeing in 2020. They spent years prepping the company for the merger and were left with their dicks hanging out when Boeing backed out last minute (Broke ass Boeing didn't have the money to go thru with the acquisition). It was the best thing that could've ever happened to them. 

With a new CEO and a new direction, Embraer is setting itself up to challenge both Boeing and Airbus in the near future. They're already the third largest commercial air aircraft manufacturer in the world and their market share only increases with the higher demand from Airlines for fuel efficient aircrafts and their growing Military and private jet segments.

Embraer aircrafts will soon be 100% of American Airline's regional fleet and many other orders to come. Also, passengers absolutely love the experience of flying on an Embraer. 

Another interesting thing about Embraer is their track record on innovation. I'd recommend you guys researching and reading up on their EVE project. They're basically leading the field in the urban air mobility segment (basically taxi/uber but with planes) and it seems very promising. They are developing a small electric aircraft intended to be used for short urban travel (up to 100 KM /60 miles).

That being said, I have to confess one the biggest reasons I like ERJ is because it would be a tremendous FUCK YOU to Boeing if they stole their share of the market. ERJ stock price is already higher than Airbus although Airbus has a much larger Market Cap. But fuck them too. ERJ to the fucking moon. 

I'm absolutely new to the stock game and should not be trusted. But I do invite you guys to learn more about this company.

If one of you regards want to take a look at their Q3 returns, here is the link: https://embraer.com/global/en/news?slug=1207478-earnings-results-3rd-quarter-2024

Red Cat Holdings, Inc. is a technology company specializing in the development of drone systems and solutions for military and commercial applications. In response to the United States renewing bans on DJI drones through legislation such as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and the American Security Drone Act, Red Cat focuses on providing advanced, domestically produced unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and related technologies. The company's products aim to enhance drone operations while addressing national security concerns by supplying secure, American-made drone solutions. Through its subsidiaries, including **Teal Drones** and **FlightWave**, Red Cat offers products that support reconnaissance, surveillance, and other critical functions, delivering innovative solutions to defense organizations and industries requiring drone capabilities[.](https://imgur.com/a/8E9PtMl)

**Investment Thesis**

Jeff Thompson, CEO of Red Cat Holdings, has outlined significant developments that position the company for substantial growth and potential undervaluation in the market. The following points highlight the company's strategic advantages and growth prospects, incorporating recent developments from the company's earnings call and industry dynamics.

# 1. Significant U.S. Army Contract

**SRR Program Win**

* **Contract Award**: Red Cat's subsidiary, **Teal Drones**, has been selected as the sole winner of the U.S. Army's **Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) program**, securing a contract to deliver **5,880 systems**. Each system includes **two drones and one controller**, amounting to a total of **11,760 drones**.
* **Contract Value**: The average price of a system is around **$45,000**, depending on configuration. This implies a base contract value of approximately **$264 million**.
* **Competitive Edge**: Teal Drones was chosen over better-funded competitors like Skydio, which has raised over **$700 million** in venture capital. Despite being an underdog, Teal's technological advancements and ability to meet the Army's stringent requirements led to this significant win.

**Additional Revenue Streams**

* **Maintenance and Support**: The contract includes provisions for repairs, training, and spare parts, which could increase the contract's value by an additional **50-70%**. Historically, programs of record have seen significant revenue from spares and support over many years.
* **Expansion Potential**: The SRR program's success positions Red Cat to secure additional contracts with other military branches, U.S. government agencies, and NATO allies.

**Program of Record Status**

* **Simplified Procurement**: Achieving **Program of Record** status streamlines the procurement process for other defense organizations, allowing them to purchase directly off the SRR contract. This designation enhances credibility and accelerates additional orders and long-term partnerships.

# 2. Anticipated Growth and Revenue Projections

**Projected Revenues**

* **Fiscal Year Projections**: The company has provided guidance of **$50-55 million** for calendar year 2025, based on the initial phases of the SRR contract.
* **Potential Upside**: With additional appropriations and the possibility of accelerated procurement, revenues could increase significantly. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes approximately **$79.5 million** in funding for the program line that supports SRR.
* **Long-Term Outlook**: Including potential additional contracts and support services, annual revenues could reach around **$100 million**, excluding new contracts.

**Future Contracts**

* **International Demand**: NATO allies and other international partners have shown strong interest in the Black Widow drone, especially after the SRR program win. Some opportunities may eclipse the SRR program in size and value.
* **Expansion into Asia-Pacific**: The company is also engaging with Asian allies, such as Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, the Philippines, and South Korea, to explore additional sales opportunities.
* **Replicator Initiative Participation**: Red Cat is involved in the Department of Defense's **Replicator program** to mass-produce affordable, autonomous drones, potentially leading to larger future contracts.

# 3. Valuation Compared to Industry Peers

**Market Valuation Discrepancy**

* **Underappreciated Value**: Despite securing a landmark contract and demonstrating significant growth potential, Red Cat's market valuation remains lower than private peers like Skydio, Anduril Industries, and Shield AI.

**Revenue Multiples**

* **Industry Comparison**: Competitors are trading at revenue multiples ranging from **18× to 28×**. For instance:
   * **Shield AI**: Trading at **18.4×** revenue.
   * **Anduril Industries**: Trading at **28×** revenue.
   * **Skydio**: Recent valuation at **$2.2 billion**, trading at **22×** revenue.
* **Red Cat's Multiple**: Based on the company's guidance, Red Cat trades at a significantly lower multiple, suggesting substantial upside potential when aligning with industry standards.

**Upside Potential**

* **Implied Valuation**: Using projected revenues of **$100 million** and applying a conservative industry revenue multiple of **20×**, Red Cat's implied market capitalization could be **$2 billion**.
* **Implied Stock Price**: With approximately **75.5 million** shares outstanding, this valuation translates to an implied stock price of approximately **$26.49** per share.
* **Potential Upside**: This represents an approximate **182% increase** from the current stock price of **$9.39**.

# 4. Strategic Capital Management

**No Immediate Capital Raise**

* **Financial Flexibility**: The company has filed a **$100 million mixed securities shelf registration**, allowing Red Cat to issue various types of securities over time. However, management has indicated **no immediate plans** to raise capital through equity offerings.
* **Utilizing Debt Instruments**: Red Cat has room on its existing debt instrument and may use this for short-term capital needs, minimizing shareholder dilution.

**Minimal Capital Raise if Needed**

* **Operational Continuity**: Any potential capital raise would be around **$10-15 million** to ensure operational efficiency without significant dilution.

**Investor Assurance**

* **Fiscal Responsibility**: CEO Jeff Thompson emphasizes a prudent approach to capital management, focusing on maximizing shareholder value and achieving cash-flow-positive operations.

# 5. Product Development and Expansion Opportunities

**Advanced Drone Focus**

* **Teal's Black Widow Drone**
   * **Technological Advancements**: The **Black Widow** is a **3-pound**, folding, backpack-size drone capable of flying autonomously without GPS, using an internal map for navigation.
   * **Electronic Warfare Resilience**: It can operate without emitting radio frequencies for up to **40 minutes**, making it less susceptible to detection and jamming—a critical advantage in modern warfare.
   * **Features**: Rugged, reliable, fully modular, quiet, long flight time and range, high-resolution cameras, stealth modes, onboard compute for AI and autonomy, capability to carry secondary payloads, and operation in electronic warfare environments.
* **Webb Controller**

   * **User-Centric Features**: Easy to use, comfortable to hold, modular, supports RF silent and stealth modes, uses the same battery as the drone, simplifying logistics.
* **Manufacturing Capabilities**
   * **High-Volume Production**: Teal has designed the Black Widow and Webb for **mass production**, with the capacity to produce **hundreds of systems per month** in low-rate initial production (LRIP) and scaling to **thousands per month** by the end of next year.
   * **Scalability**: The manufacturing facility can increase output by adding shifts, including moving to two or three shifts and operating on weekends.

**Edge 130 Drone**

* **FlightWave Acquisition**: Red Cat's acquisition of FlightWave adds the **Edge 130** drone to its portfolio.
* **Order Backlog**: Over **200 orders** for the Edge 130, expected to be delivered in Q1.
* **New Facility**: The company is moving into a new factory to accommodate production needs.

**Mass Deployment Readiness**

* **Scalability**: Red Cat's drones are well-suited for large-scale deployment initiatives like the Replicator program and can meet the high demand seen in conflicts such as Ukraine.
* **Red Cat Futures Initiative**
   * **R&D Focus**: The company is pursuing research and development opportunities to integrate capabilities with strategic partners, enhancing their product offerings and addressing future mission needs.
   * **Software Ecosystem**: Plans to offer a menu of configurations and software applications for different use cases, leveraging the onboard compute power for AI and autonomy.

# 6. Increased Industry Recognition

* **Progress**: Both drones have passed initial testing phases and are moving into the final stage, involving review of bill of materials and cybersecurity practices.

# 7. Competitive Landscape and Industry Challenges

**Competitor Challenges**

* **Skydio's Setbacks**
   * **Operational Failures**: Skydio's drones underperformed in Ukraine, suffering from electronic warfare tactics that led to loss of control and drones going off course.
   * **Loss of SRR Contract**: Skydio lost out to Teal Drones in the SRR program, despite significant venture capital backing.
* **Other Competitors**
   * **AeroVironment's Switchblade Drones**: Faced difficulties due to Russian jamming and GPS blackouts, impacting their reliability.
   * **Cyberlux's Production Issues**: Failed to meet production and delivery goals, affecting credibility.

**Red Cat's Competitive Edge**

* **Technological Superiority**: Red Cat's drones are designed to withstand electronic warfare, operate without GPS, and meet the rigorous requirements of modern battlefields.
* **Mission-Driven Approach**: The company's focus on building drones specifically to meet the Army's needs contributed to winning the SRR contract.
* **Manufacturing Readiness**: Red Cat's ability to mass-produce drones efficiently positions it favorably against competitors who may struggle with production scaling.

# 8. Strategic Partnerships and Government Relations

**Advocacy and Policy Support**

* **Government Engagement**: Red Cat is actively working with the Department of Defense and Congress to ensure funding and support for expanding the SRR program.
* **NDAA Funding**: The National Defense Authorization Act includes approximately **$79.5 million** for the SRR program line, with efforts to increase appropriations in future fiscal years.

**International Opportunities**

* **NATO Allies**: Multiple NATO countries are showing strong interest in adopting the Black Widow drone, with some potential contracts larger than the SRR program.
* **Asia-Pacific Expansion**: Engagement with countries like Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, the Philippines, and South Korea opens additional markets.

# 9. Management and Leadership

**Experienced Team**

* **CEO Jeff Thompson**: Emphasizes fiscal responsibility, strategic growth, and maximizing shareholder value.
* **George Matus**: Founder of Teal Drones, instrumental in designing the Black Widow and Webb controller, focused on meeting Army requirements and soldier feedback.
* **Geoff Hitchcock**: Brings decades of experience from previous roles at AeroVironment, contributing to securing programs of record and international expansion.

**Board of Directors**

* **General Paul Funk II**: Recently joined the board, providing valuable insights from his military experience, emphasizing the importance of kinetic capabilities and battlefield needs.

**Stock Price Potential Based on Updated Calculations**

* **Current Market Capitalization**: Approximately **$480 million** (reflecting recent stock performance).
* **Current Stock Price**: **$9.39** (as per the latest data).
* **Shares Outstanding**: Approximately **75.5 million**.
* **Projected Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue**: **$100 million** (potentially higher with additional appropriations and contracts).
* **Industry Revenue Multiple**: **20×** annual revenue.

**Implied Valuation**

* **Implied Market Capitalization**: $100 million × 20 = **$2 billion**.
* **Implied Stock Price**: $2 billion / 75.5 million shares = Approximately **$26.49** per share.

**Potential Upside**

* **Percentage Increase**: (($26.49 - $9.39) / $9.39) × 100% = Approximately **182% increase**.

**Considerations and Assumptions**

* **Revenue Achievement**: The company successfully achieves the projected revenues through the execution of the SRR contract and potential additional contracts with other military branches, government agencies, and international customers.
* **Market Valuation Alignment**: The market values Red Cat at a 20× revenue multiple, consistent with industry peers.
* **Technological Leadership**: Red Cat continues to innovate and maintain its technological edge over competitors.
* **Production Scaling**: The company effectively scales production to meet demand, maintaining quality and efficiency.

**Conclusion**

Red Cat Holdings appears to be undervalued relative to its industry peers. With a significant U.S. Army contract, anticipated growth, and involvement in key defense initiatives, the company is strategically positioned for potential expansion. The high demand for reliable drones in modern conflicts, combined with competitors' shortcomings, amplifies Red Cat's market opportunity. The company's mission-driven approach, technological advancements, and manufacturing readiness provide a strong foundation for growth.

Investors should consider these factors while also conducting their own due diligence. The discrepancy between Red Cat's current market valuation and that of its peers suggests substantial upside potential.

Greetings my friends, and prepare yourselves. Join me as we learn the wey of gey.

What you see before your very eyes is an experimental portfolio I have made. No real money is involved, but essentially this is a watchlist on E\*Trade with share quantities assigned to each stock to fit my hypothetical allocations.

The purpose of this portfolio--gey.

By tilting heavily to the gey factor, we hope to realize the rawdog premium.

The core of this portfolio is Grindr (GRND). It holds a 27% allocation (I had to convince myself to not make it 30% for diversification's sake, although such is still not off the table entirely). The path of gey is risky, but potentially rewarding. Grindr holds what many consider to be somewhat of a monopoly on the LGBTQ+ dating and hookup market. Only the individual who achieves great wealth from Grindr stock can become a true Lord of the Gey.

The other stocks that makeup The Fruitcake Portfolio are stocks that one might consider to be gey-in-some-wey. In reality, this means we must invest in stocks typically designated ""women"" stocks. Now personally, I love stocks of companies whose target audience is women. Just because the product isn't some sci-fi tech robot A.I. missile etc etc, doesn't mean that it isn't a good company with amazing potential. I personally already own ELF and \[redacted\] in my real accounts. However, in this portfolio, beauty, cosmetics, and baby/household care products (diapers, etc) make up around 26% in total (17% for ELF, 9% for \[redacted\]).

Hims & Hers (HIMS) was selected for it's exposure to the men's sexual health market. They got ED pills, condoms, lube, prostate massagers, cock rings, etc. With the addition of a 10% HIMS allocation, The Fruitcake Portfolio will be on all fours, back arched, with its cheeks up in the air for exposure to the chode of this lucrative industry. In addition to HIMS, there is also a small 2% allocation to Church & Dwight (CHD), because they make Trojan condoms.

FBTC is the Fidelity BitCoin ETF. This is the only crypto play in the portfolio and makes up 10% of the portfolio.

If Warren Buffet has Coca Cola (KO), then The Fruitcake Portfolio has Starbucks (SBUX), because Starbucks is zesty, and therefore, perfectly suited, as those who regularly drink from Starbucks follow the wey of gey. Similarly, Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) is more of a growthy-value stability stock in the restaurant sector. I wanted to originally find a vegan or vegetarian stock, however those tend to fail. However, CAKE actually has been expanding its business lately with the restaurant Flower Child. Flower Child serves vegan, vegetarian, paleo dishes, and more. So yes, CAKE is a bit of a compromise pick, but I think it fulfills the requirement of gey.

There is an 11% allocation split between Victoria's Secret (VSCO), Lululemon (LULU), and Nike (NKE). Overall, this is more of a value play and a smaller weight. VSCO is the primary holding here.

Disney (DIS) and Netflix (NFLX) are tiny allocations to streaming services. Need I explain why they are perfect for The Fruitcake Portfolio? If you are a 35 year old male millennial, and you still visit Mickey Mouse every year and take pictures with Cinderella, then you are no novice to the wey of gey.

Finally, we have a tiny 1% allocation to Google (GOOG). Literally the alphabet company.

Something interesting to note is that this portfolio actually tilts very heavily into midcaps. Once ELF becomes a large cap, then things will be more balanced. I’ve considered adding a SCV as well.

\----------------

For stocks and ETFS that didn't make the cut, I had:

TSLA & FSLR: The wey of gey is partial to EVs and clean energy.

VEGN: Basically a cruelty-free S&P 500. Considered including this and removing a bunch of the large cap stocks in the portfolio.

\[redacted\]: An OTC Malaysian stock that I could probably buy through interactive broker. It's particularly NSFW.

\[redacted\]: Weed Stocks.

TGT: Target is Target.

BBWI: Bath and Bodyworks for scented candles and slippery bathtub moments--with bubbles (ofc).

RVLV: Clothing Retailer.

\----------------

If anyone has any ideas of how they might improve this portfolio, feel free to let me know. Any interesting stocks that you think might fit well in the mix? Would you swap out anything?

I plan to track this portfolio's performance. I'm thinking I'll actually buy Grindr shares next week.",50,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h0w1eq/the_fruitcake_portfolio/

financialindependence,Logged Off For the Last Time Today,"It's done.  Still seems hard to believe and surreal and I'm sure it's going to take a while to really sink in.  At age 53, after roughly 25 years of spending less than we earn and investing the difference, I've decided this is it.  I was able to arrange a layoff so that I'll get severance until next June and health benefits until next April before we switch over to my wife's healthcare plan.  She wants to keep working for now but we'll see how long that lasts.

It really works.  We started doing most of the things that people talk about here many years ago before people were using the ""FIRE"" terminology.  We almost always maxed our 401k accounts (not quite at the beginning with lower incomes and not near the end as compounding started doing most of the work), we spent less than we earned, we bought things on sale and always tried to moderate our spending.  We didn't deprive ourselves of everything along the way but we also didn't live extravagantly.  By most people's measures, they'd say we were living pretty good.  I guess it's all relative.

Final net worth number at retirement: $3.7M.  It has really shot up over the last few years.  I've posted previously about our net worth progression if you want to check my post history.  Basically it took us about 17 years to hit the first million, (1998-2015), 4 years to hit $2M, 3 years to hit $3M and now we are at about $3.7M.  Salaries started at about $32K for me and less for my wife.  She also took a few years off when our child was born.  At the end my salary had climbed to $155K and my wife is at $75K.  It certainly got easier as our salaries increased but we made sure not to let our lifestyle inflate too much along with the salaries.  We also never carried a credit card balance and started paying cash for pretty much everything, cars included, many years ago. (We focused on reliable Honda's and Toyota's)  It's amazing how cheaply you can live once your house is paid off and you have no other debt.  I recognize it's more difficult to do that now.  We were lucky to be in GenX where you could still buy a house for a reasonable price.  That certainly helped our net worth progression but it wasn't the only reason we were successful.

Thanks to everyone's contributions here.  I've learned a ton from the community and I think having everyone reinforcing the right strategies and methods and sharing knowledge helps us all.  Cheers!  I'll be around and hope to document the peaks and valleys and share how our investments are either supporting our lifestyle or are falling short.",1085,145,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1h1clt3/logged_off_for_the_last_time_today/
financialindependence,Another 500k milestone achieved post,"Seeing some posts on this topic, I thought I'd share ours too, as our background and income are a bit different from those who have already posted.

My wife and I recently crossed €500k in our brokerage account. We are SI1K, I am the sole breadwinner, and in addition to my salary, we also have some rental income. The rental income is sufficient to cover the mortgage on our home, with some leftover. My income is about €95k gross per year (incl. the bonuses), and our combined net worth, based on my calculations and property value estimations, is around €800k (brokerage, rental propery, home - remaning mortgage, paid off cars, cash)

We both come from modest backgrounds, we didn't inherit anything and didn't receive any notable financial support from our families. What I did receive was some equity from the company I worked for previously and the company I’m currently with. When exit events occurred, I sold the equity and  transferred the windfall (\~€200k in total for two events) to our brokerage account, using part of it as a down payment for our home. I still have some equity that will be sold as soon as they vest.

Our savings rate used to be over 70%, but then COVID happened, we had a baby, bought a single-family home, inflation skyrocketed, and I took up an expensive hobby: collecting tools (and doing some woodworking with them). Now, our savings rate is around 40%, which I think is still quite good.

Our investments are in all world index ETFs mainly WVCE. WVCE and chill, baby! :)

We live in the Balkans, where the pension system is slowly collapsing. While I’m required to contribute, I consider it money thrown out the window.

I’m 41 now, and my goal is to leave the grind and corporate life behind in about 10 years. After that, I plan to focus on something more enjoyable and less stressful.

financialindependence,Just hit 500K in investments ,"FIRE + fed employee with a family?    I had a screenshot ready to post of reaching 500K and only now finding out no attachments are allowed. 

46M fed employee and just reached ~500K in investments and $705K NW.  Spouse is 45 and we have a 7 year old. 

I realize this isn’t the “reached 500K or 1M investments in my 20s or 30s” post, but I wanted to put this out there as an alternative, perhaps more realistic example.   I only started working and contributing to a work retirement account in 2008, so I’ve been working for about 16 years.  I spent my 20s pursuing a professional, advanced degree which ironically has nothing to do with my current career (although I do maintain and renew that license annually) and my early 30s digging myself out of student loan and CC debt.   

Annual income is 154,226 (gross as of 2023) and I’m the sole earner, working two jobs for ~60 hours/week ever since our son was born.  My wife also has contributed so much, sacrificing her career to raise our son until he was able to enter public school at 5 years old; he’s an academically advanced kid for his age, and we supplement his public school experience with various enrichment programs to keep him challenged.   Crossing fingers he’ll be eligible for ample scholarships when the time comes for higher education.     

 As a federal employee, I’ve often wondered how FIRE would work in our situation, but roughly I’d love to be able to leave federal employment as early as 57 with postponed retirement and apply to retire at 62 to lock in the medical benefits (assuming my wife is employed by then)    The FERS pension also keeps me wanting to stay on until at least 57.  I've also considered working until 60 when I'm eligible for full retirement or at the typical age of 62, although I’m not really sure I want to work until that age. 

 I’m really looking forward to cutting back hours as my wife eventually wants to re-enter the workforce, but until then, I’ll keep the same work schedule.

Assets: 

·         HYSA:  ~15000

·         Home equity (~192K)

·         Two vehicles (approximate total value $13K), and yes I drive a Toyota Corolla.

financialindependence,How to enjoy money?,"Ever since I was a child, I have always been aware that there were financial problems in the family. It wasn't like there was no food on the table, it was like my dad made a lot of money but spent frivolously and had a lot of debt. And my mom would skimp and skimp and while on the outside it looked like we were a rich family, in reality I rarely got any toys or dolls I asked for.

By the time I was 18 the family money had run out, I was more aware than ever that when it came time for my parents to retire they would look to me and my sibling for money. I worked very hard in school and had a part-time job throughout undergrad and grad, there were times when I would leave an exam early to go to a job, or even spend exam time catching up on sleep. Those were very difficult years where I barely socialized or did anything that needed money, every single cent I earned I socked away into a savings account. Luckily I had a lot of scholarships and had a positive net worth gain when I was done with university. But I was already planning to FIRE, all I wanted was to stop worrying about money. I hated the idea that I needed to work to deserve basic necessities, I felt strongly that housing and food should be a human right and I was going to secure that for myself.

I'm now 32, I'm on track to make 300k in 2025 (it's my current salary), and my net worth just hit 600k with the recent bull run. I've only been working full time for 6 years and I started with a 55k salary so that's why my net worth doesn't reflect my income. I live comfortably in a VHCOL city, spending 30% of my take home pay. However, due to some bad luck with landlords, I'm being harassed to the point of having to move out for my mental health. My friends (I have many now, yay) encouraged me to go for something that makes me happy instead of the cheapest thing on the market. After a lot of math, I realized that the difference between picking the cheapest thing and the one I love only results in a few months's difference in FI timeline - assuming similar spend in ""retirement"". However, now it seems I will be spending 50% of my take home on expenses (not counting equities and bonuses, only guaranteed base pay).

So I decided that this would be a good time for me to learn how to enjoy money, maybe save less money, but actually focus on the present, because who knows how long this life will last. Also, after living with myself for 32 years, I'm sure I will find something to do even in retirement that will end up being another career. It's just in my nature. I understand now that this is the lesson I need to learn the the path I need to take. However - how do I actually get there? How do I actually be happy and enjoy myself? It's so odd that I know this is logically that this is the right decision but emotionally it feels \_wrong\_.

I'm not looking for financial advice, however, has anyone gone through this before? How do you learn to enjoy the fruits of your labour?

I apologize if anyone is offended by this post - I acknowledge that I have a lot of privilege, I know this is a first world problem. I know that when I was struggling in my 20s, this is the type of problem I wish I could have instead.

TLDR: parents bad with money, grew up with financial anxiety, spent 20s struggling with bare necessities, 32 now and making good money but feel bad about spending more than what I'm used to.

financialindependence,Talk me off the ledge,"Hi

I am a 29m. My net worth is about $500k usd, only including financial assets and cash equivalents.

I mainly buy what some call asset allocation / life cycle funds, 80% equity and 20% fixed income.

I am scared of a company like microstrategy being included in the index and am considering a few options:

- switch to the most conservative lifecycles fund (80% fixed income, 20% equity)

- switch to value and international equity index funds only (e.g. FLCOX,SCHV, FTIHX)

- switch to actively managed funds

I really dont want to do any of this, but if my 80% equity is going to be highly concentrated in 7 stocks and be exposed to crypto, I think I'm out. I only need a 4% rate of return to reach my financial goals given my current savings and expected contributions.

financialindependence,Essential financial management for busy FIREy parents?,"Hey y'all!

My partner and I are busy full-time workers in tech with a kiddo at home. This has made us incredibly busy, and made it really hard to find the time to do as much management of our finances as we used to. Pre-kid, I would monitor every transaction on Mint ensuring it was properly categorized, and would review monthly or so to evaluate spending trends and etc. Post-kid, expense tracking (and frankly, expenses) have gone out the window, because I can't sit down at the computer/phone for more than 2 minutes before the kid needs something or wants to play. We also don't have a great sleeper, so there's not that much time after he goes to bed, and it's mostly spent unwinding.

I'm sure any advice would apply to extremely busy non-parents too.

What should we prioritize and make time for when it comes to keeping tabs on our finances? If you had (or have) extremely limited time, what would you make sure you do, and what techniques would you use to do it?

Frankly, I think we're getting pretty close to our FIRE number, probably within 2-3 years of possible FIRE, but I don't have time to sit down and plan for it properly, and even if I made time I'm not sure what the essential things to do would be with that time!

We currently:

* Use Quicken Simplifi, make sure to maintain it such that all accounts we own are linked, and make sure we check it once or twice a month. This makes sure we don't miss when a credit card annual fee has posted, or fraudulent transactions haven't been missed.
* Do a very short financial pow-wow twice a month (after each paycheck cycle) to move money around and decide how much to put in our long-term savings/brokerage account, and rebalance via new contributions
* Have the majority of our savings or regular expenses (Retirement, setting aside daycare payments/property tax/home insurance/etc, HSA, IRA) on automatic transfers or paycheck deductions
* Yearly, we:
   * Invest in things that need annual contributions like IRA
   * Do some high-level evaluations of how much we spent (basically, W2 income minus taxes & retirement contributions minus known savings contributions from account statements... whatever's left is what we spent)
   * Do essential tax estimation and planning (e.g., are we going to owe the IRS a lot of money in April? Do we need to set aside some money to pay them?)
   * Generally check up on account balances and take a look at our net worth

What essential steps do others do? For the steps you take, how do you do them as time-efficiently as possible? (We're happy to spend money on tools if they helped us do essential planning more quickly). We're totally lacking in any forecasting, future-looking planning steps... we are very mathematically/financially savvy but just lack the time to do stuff...

financialindependence,Does the plan change at 10M+?,"I have thus far been committed to the low-fee index fund investment style, and it is working well. 

But extrapolating out across the decades, and assuming everything continues to go well, should my strategy change at some point? I vaguely intend to shift some of my portfolio to lower-risk investments at some point, but that also requires little in the way of active management. 

Is there a point where getting a financial advisor/manager makes sense? Do other investment vehicles become more useful when you reach a certain threshold? ",0,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1h1b52d/does_the_plan_change_at_10m/

financialindependence,"Milestone, £2 million - no one else to share with","Hi everyone 

I posted four years ago about my first £1 million.  Since then, I've continued to invest religiously my post-tax income into SP500 and FTSE All World index funds.  I also bought a flat two years ago, and include the money I put in the flat (not interest, stamp duty or fees) into my net worth. And today, lo and behold, I am now 44 and my net worth crossed £2 million for the first time ever.

All that to say Warren Buffet is right.  Being boring and saving regularly into index funds works.  And, indeed, time in the market beats timing the market.

If you’re interested, I tracked the rate at which I made my investments on a U.K. tax year basis (the year ends on 5 April - so 2021 means investments made between 6 April 2020 and 5 April 2021).

financialindependence,Lots of bullshit at job - Wondering if I'm in a position to quit,"I'm hoping for some advice from the FI community. I strongly dislike my current role and am wondering if I can use some FI leverage I've built to change the situation.

I received a PhD in Physics in 2022. I was hired for my first job soon after and worked at that company for 1.5 years. It was a really great experience. The work was interesting, I had hybrid work, autonomy, and a path to greater responsibility. I could have seen myself spending over 5 years there.

However, my partner and I did not want to live in the location. So I applied to new positions and eventually received an offer for my current role. I started earlier this year.

It's been a definite downgrade. Our engineering team is understaffed. There are restrictive policies I can't go into here that make work life and home life more difficult than they need to be. Work is fully on-site, which isn't the worst thing, but it is a downgrade. It's also a younger, smaller team, which adds to the expectation and social pressure to take on too much, even to one's own detriment. It's a pressure cooker, and people sometimes snap angrily at each other.

**Our net worth is about $500k. We have no kids. It makes me think I just don't need to put up with this.** We've been pursuing FI, and even though we're not there yet, it might be time to pull some of that leverage. I know most people would say to just put up with stuff like this, but the whole point of FI is to challenge common advice like that. And I know for a fact that better situations exist.

**Does this sound like a situation where I suck it up? Or move on? Does our net worth change the calculus on this question?**

------------------------

Summary of stats for partner and I are below. Don't want to give exact numbers, but it's close enough for folks to offer advice.

Ages: Both about 30 years old

Marital status: Engaged

Kids: None. Maybe in 5 years. Not in a rush. Open to adoption.

Assets: $520k ($470k invested)

Debt: $500-1000 on credit cards, paid off in full each month. No mortgage.

Expenses: About $65k per year (rent is about $2k/mo)

Gross Income: $130k (me) and $75k (partner)",10,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gzolnf/lots_of_bullshit_at_job_wondering_if_im_in_a/
financialindependence,Want to FIRE at the end of next year,"Appreciate and value everyone's input and experiences on here. Want to FIRE at the end of next year- are we ready? 41 male and 39 female, no kids, no plans to have any.

Total NW - $1.63M

Combined balances:
401k - 73K (new job in the last few years)

Roth IRA - 311K

Rollover Trad IRA - 474K

Brokerage - 747K

Cash - 26K


Of the brokerage, 154K has a 13K cap gain, the rest are locked in at average cost (a mistake I made). I plan to add 30K next year to that plus I will have about 10K in dividends from the brokerage, and hopefully with some growth, taking that to 200K. 

I have no room to harvest any gains this year. I should be able to harvest about $15K in gains in 2025. I plan to use the brokerage to fund us for the next 5 years while I start Roth conversion of 30K a year. Year 6 would start withdraws of Roth conversion plus using dividends and some cap gains to fund us.

I have done the math several different ways and our expenses are at max $4K a month if I give it a good amount of padding. This includes ACA coverage, assuming 2025 rates.

financialindependence,Impact of Market Volatility in Final 2 years of Work ,"Hey all, wanted to get some feedback on how you approach market volatility in your last year or two and trying to hit your FI/RE number.
For me, my number is 2.8 million (100k drawdown, 3.6% SWR) and I’m currently just shy of 2.5 million NW. So another 12-18 months should do it, between saving about 150k-200k of my own wages + company contributions in that time, and then assuming the market returns a subpar 4%-5%. 
But with current valuations, and market uncertainty due to incoming policies, we could certainly get another 10% + return year… and then a  25%+ correction. Or a 25% + correction and then the start of a new bull run. But obviously if we get the correction first, my 2.5 million goes below 2 million, and then im more like 3-4 years away from FIRE
So what do you do when you’re close (2 years or less) to FIRE, assume your NW based on the higher previous valuations, like had you made that money just a year sooner, you’d be done, or be at the mercy of market fluctuations as you try and hit a fixed number?",41,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gyrtzr/impact_of_market_volatility_in_final_2_years_of/
financialindependence,I just hit $4M in net worth,"I just hit $4M in net worth.  I don't really have anyone else I would talk to about this so posting here.  I hope this will be an encouragement to others.

I am married and have 4 kids, each of whom is now married and has their own kids.  I have been the sole bread winner of the family since our second was born.  I work in technology and nearing retirement.   Between us and our parents, we got our kids through college with minimal debt, bought some cars, and paid for some weddings.  We have moved 9 times.

The net worth journey was $100K - 1996, $1M - 2012, $2M - 2018, $3M - 2021, $4M - 2024.  The mortgage was first paid off in 2018, and that seemed to unlock a faster pace of growth in net worth.

The asset mix is (in $K):

* $1,920K  401K/IRA
* $347K  Roth 401K/IRA
* $303K  Pension
* $134K  HSA
* 109  Savings
* 35  529 Fund
* 1,044  House
* 109  Non liquid - Cars, Jewelry, Cameras, etc.

Retirement investments are ETFs and mutual funds, pretty much all equities.

I haven't really done anything crazy.  I've got basic knowledge of this stuff.  I don't have any advisor.  I have made plenty of bad financial decisions and had some bad luck along the way, but also had some good luck too.  My tips for what I did are here.

* Live below your means, but don't be a miser either.
* Contribute to your retirement funds consistently.
* Diversify in a mix of good quality funds, no individual stocks.
* The Pension fund has represented my pseudo ""bond"" coverage and everything else is in almost all equities.  I can take it out as an annuity or cash balance.
* Leave everything alone when there is a down year.  With the big dips in 2008 and 2022, I stayed the course and was back to pre dip the year after.
* Get out of debt

Tax-Free Growth Investments: $52,640 (a ROTH IRA)

\* What else should I be doing now to make my 50 y/o retirement a reality? I've run some numbers with Projection Lab and because of my high expenses it shows more like 54.

financialindependence,Pre-FIRE Checklist?,"I'm a few months away from retiring.  I'd appreciate if someone can let me know if there's something I'm missing that I should be doing in the final months before FIREing.  This is not a ""do I have enough to FIRE"" question.  Let's assume I have enough saved.  I'm 58, married but no kids.  My wife will still be working.

* Work:  I'm timing my retirement for profit sharing and bonus time.  I'm frontloading my 401(k) and HSA to max them out before I leave.  My work doesn't know I'm retiring yet.  I've put in a succession plan so my staff will be okay when I leave.
* Drawdown: I have two years worth of expenses saved in HYSA and CDs.  I plan to draw down from these initially for the first year(s) until I can tune my long term drawdown strategies.
* Asset allocation:  I'm something like 80% stock (index/mutual funds), 10% bonds, 10% cash.
* Health Insurance:  I'll do COBRA for my health insurance initially until I apply for ACA.  I'm 58 and will apply for medicare at 65.  I'm budgeting $800 a month for health insurance; maybe it will be $1K.  I realize there will be new administration and things may change with ACA and Medicare, but I don't think it will change to the point where it's completely off the table.  I'm reasonably healthy and active.  I'm getting as many of my doctor appointments and check ups out of the way now.
* Expenses: I live in a HCOL area and will do more travelling in my first retirement years.  But I expect to scale expense back as I get older.  I think I have my budgeting correct.
* Long Term Care:  I've done some preliminary research on LTC, and I'm not getting it or at least not now.  From what I've seen it's expensive and when you need it, it may not be there for you because the insurance companies make it difficult to claim for it.
* Parental Care:  Both of my parents passed away.  My wife's parents are getting older.  They are good financially.
* House/Car: I have a modest mortgage on my house and the interest rate is below 3%.  The mortgage is about 15% of the value of the house.  Maybe we'll relocate and maybe we won't.  My car is three years old.  I own it and it's in good condition.
* Activities:  I know it will be an adjustment and there will be challenges with being bored when I'm not working, but I'm not concerned about it.

What else am I missing or what else do you recommend I do now?  I'm looking forward to the day!  Thank you in advance.",42,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gyevsr/prefire_checklist/
financialindependence,"Plan for next 2-3 years advice and recommendation for it
","I’m 23M, and while life is good, I want to stop messing around and start building a future for myself and my future family. So that's why I’ve developed a plan for the next couple of years and would love your advice or insights, especially since I have no idea what Im doing. Anything helps honestly I want you all to be as honest as possible I really want to do this right.

# My Situation:

* **Income**: Recently started a job paying $70,000/year.
* **Credit Score**: Currently 707, aiming to improve it over the next two years.
* **Living Situation**: Staying with supportive parents, which allows me to save money.
* **Savings**: After covering expenses, I can save $3,000–$4,000/month, giving me hopefully $60,000 or more but 50-60k is the minimum in two years.

# The Plan:

1. **Save Aggressively**: Save at least $60,000 for a down payment and related expenses.
2. **Buy a Duplex**:
   * Location: Plan to invest in Texas due to affordable prices. I don't live in Texas nor do I plan on living there, I just want to buy the property there.
   * Budget: $150k–$300k. Aiming for $250k, a 16% down payment is what Im aiming for which would be around 40ish K for 250k. All these prices are ideal in my opinion.
   * Mortgage: Expecting monthly payments would be around $1,700–$2,000. Also Ideal for me.
3. **Rental Income**: I don't plan in living in the duplex the plan is to rent both units out and for the the rent from both tenants to cover the mortgage on the property. My goal is for the property to break even or generate slight profit.
4. **Emergency Fund**: After I've completed the purchase of the property I hope to have around $20,000 aside for unexpected costs.
5. **Repeat**: After I buy the first property the plan would be to keep living with my parents and save up for another year and repeat the process until I have 3-4 properties to my portfolio.

# Key Assumptions & Challenges:

* **Rental Market**: Unsure how much I can charge for rent or how much I have to put down on the down payments—relied on estimates from Zillow and other research for that info
* **Parent Support**: Staying with my parents is critical to save money and I have a great relationship with them and don't plan on it changing, but I know circumstances might change.
* **Long-Term Goal**: Build a solid foundation for financial independence and passive income through real estate.

I hope this is clear and easy to follow. I understand some of you might think this plan is a bit optimistic, but I genuinely believe it’s achievable, and having a solid plan for the next couple of years is a strong starting point.

I’d love any advice or insights, especially on potential challenges I might face. Please feel free to be as honest as possible—whether it’s about the feasibility of investing in Texas versus another state, or any tips for a beginner in real estate. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

* 137K left on our mortgage (house worth about 675K)

* no car payments

* two young adult kids. We’re about to help one pay for a master’s degree. 


My spouse is self-employed and reliably earns anywhere from 250-300K a year, but obviously a lot goes to taxes. I earn 63K a year at my very normal job, but the real focus has always been that it provides health insurance, long-term insurance, etc. 

I’ve worked at the same place for almost 20 years, nine of those being work from home. Recently my employer made several sweeping changes, and we’ve lost our ability to work from home. They’ve also installed productivity software on all of our computers, which makes me seethe. There have been other demoralizing changes made within my department that, while they haven’t impacted me directly, have impacted folks that I care about and who are likely to leave. 

Because I’ve been nose to the grindstone all these years with the intention of working until we hit two million and a paid off house, I’m struggling to figure out if we’re in good enough shape that I can stop working. We’d lose my income, our taxes would be higher without mine off-setting my spouse’s, and we’d have to shell out a hell of a lot for good insurance because of several chronic health issues. I have absolutely no interest in leaving this job and finding another; if I leave, it will be because I am done (as long as spouse continues to earn at the same rate).

Is it bananas to think that I could finish up over the next few months and that we could safely survive on my spouse’s income? I know that it’s a decent income, but the self-employment part stresses me out a bit. I’m sorry that this is so long…I appreciate any thoughts that you have!",0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gyiw3e/could_i_pull_the_trigger/

financialindependence,[new milestone] 29F | 800k not engineer/ 10 yr journey ,"I wanted to share my story because I’m so happy to achieve this new milestone. Here is my 10 year journey:

Age/ Year / Income/ Net worth  

20 / 2015/ $26k / $10k  

21/ 2016/ $47k/ $20k  

22/ 2017/ $57k/ $40k  

23/ 2018/ $70k/ $80k. 

24/ 2019/ $82k/ $130k. 

25/ 2020/ $120k/ $180k. 

26/ 2021/ $118k/ $310k (moved and took a pay cut). 

27/ 2022/ $136k/ $340k. 

28/2023/ $170k/ $500k. 

29/ 2024/ $194k/ $800k. 

I graduated college with a non STEM degree at 20 and started working a bit. Started a Roth IRA at age 20. Family does not come from wealth as they are immigrants with blue collar jobs (restaurants/services). They don’t speak English and they don’t have a college education. They help when they can such as some college expenses and a car after graduating, but I kept it minimal by staying in state and scholarships. I worked throughout high school and college part time. My entire career was in finance with a mix of industry finance and financial services. Jumped jobs every 1-2 years for the first half of my career in financial services and stayed in the second half in industry finance. All of my jobs were hired through cold connections.

My habits haven’t changed since 20. I never lived at home but I try to pay only $1k/month in rent even in 2024. I’ve lived in not so great neighborhoods with roommates and drove the same car since graduating college. Heavily invested in the market. 80% of portfolio is in the index. I set aside max $150k to gamble in stocks. I don’t think I beat the index and probably paid more in taxes but it’s kind of fun. I churn a lot and have over a million in points currently but probably two million since I started churning over the last 10 years. I try to be meticulous with churning from business cards/personal cards and re-qualifying after 48 months. College/jobs are all west coast based.

Starting a career early and investing helped a lot. Anyways, I wouldn’t be where I’m at without my family and friend’s influence -both good/bad. The bad part is that my family was always stressing about money such as gambling/stupid purchases so that made me who I am today. The good part is that they always worked hard which made me develop good ethics/work habits. I guess it’s work hard and play hard, except I don’t really play since I’ve been so focused on my FIRE journey. I’ve rejected weddings and bachelorettes throughout my 20s because my network of friends likes to be lavish (5-star places) and I generally do not like parties.

As I enter my 30s, I’m likely going to loosen up a bit. Maybe start living better and purchase a new car. Anyways, for the younger folks out there - take risk, invest when you can and never look back. For older folks, I’d love to hear any nuggets of wisdom you may have.",188,105,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gws8mw/new_milestone_29f_800k_not_engineer_10_yr_journey/
financialindependence,ERN CAPE based withdrawal strategy,"Hi folks,

I’ve spent far too long down the [Early Retirement Now](https://earlyretirementnow.com/safe-withdrawal-rate-series/) rabbit hole and am feeling torn about which strategy to adopt. I’m 42 years old and expect to reach financial independence (FI) by 48, though I don’t plan to fully retire (RE) until somewhere between 48 and 52, depending on work scenarios.

I’m fairly confident I can hit my FI number, but I’m less certain about my post-retirement withdrawal strategy.

Initially, I leaned towards a simple bond tent: reducing equities to 60% at 48, holding there until 52, and then gradually increasing back to 100% by 60. While this approach works well from a safe withdrawal rate (SWR) perspective, it doesn’t account for the ongoing value of my portfolio or much flexibility in spending. I’m also unsure how I’d feel about being 100% in equities at 65 (though the maths suggests the portfolio would likely be large enough for me not to care).

More recently, I’ve been exploring ERN’s CAPE-based approach. My initial impressions are positive—it seems like a solid option since it adjusts withdrawal rates based on your portfolio’s real valuation, for better or worse.

[The SWR Toolbox](https://twosidesoffi.com/toolbox/) makes this relatively straightforward to model, and I’d highly recommend it as a resource.

There are a few questions that someone who is more experienced may be able to answer. The allocation tab has no effect on the outcome of the CAPE SWR. I have watched 2sides of fi discuss this and they brushed over it saying 'Karsten says equity allocation between 60 and 100 will work fine'. On the ERN page it states these are modelled on 80%. Does it matter?

Secondly when I alter the 'Final Value Target (%of initial)' on the main tab, this changes every time I alter the 'Portfolio today' under cash flow assist. This means that when updating going forward the FVT will not be based on initial, rather the ongoing portfolio valve. Can this be changed?

And finally, looking at a more hybrid approach to pull this all together. Would it make sense to glide down to 60% equity at retirement, then glide back up to 80% whilst implementing CAPE SWR, or does the CAPE SWR nullify the need to mitigate against SORR, and therefore not bother with a glideslope.

Has anyone here implemented CAPE-based rules for their withdrawal strategy? I’d love to hear your thoughts or experiences!",50,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gwg4cw/ern_cape_based_withdrawal_strategy/
financialindependence,Backdoor Roth- Pro Rata Rule,"Hey all, I'm nervous to pull the trigger on this IRA/roth IRA back door stuff. I think it makes financial since for me to do, but I'm not sure the actual steps. I know a little about the Pro-rata rule, but don't really understand it. 

I've been at my current employer 5+ years. I have an open Roth IRA account that I contributed to early in my career here. Then I ended up over the income limit, so opened a trad IRA and recharacterized the contributions I needed to per my CPA. These are my only IRA accounts.   
  
For the last 2-3 years, I've been maxing out the traditional IRA account. I realize now that wasn't the smartest plan, since my employer has a work place retirement plan. So these contributions really aren't doing a lot for me tax advantage wise. I'm trying to figure out what I need to do. 

This year, I've contributed the $7,000 max to the traditional IRA account. 

My employer 401(k) will accept IRA roll overs. So I'm thinking I need to roll over all the pre-2024 IRA contributions to my employer account, then backdoor the 2024 contributions? Is that possible? 

Or should I just wait? Move all trad IRA funds to 401(k) and do plan to do the backdoor part next year?

Help please. I've been avoiding this for a while now cause I'm nervous and don't want to mess it up. Trad IRA balance is about $25,000. 

I met with a financial planner and he told me to ask a CPA. ",12,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gwowiw/backdoor_roth_pro_rata_rule/

financialindependence,How do you power through the last 5 years or so?,"I won't bore you with the financial details but I have about 5 years left in my plan to be financially independent and retire, but I am burnt out and wondering how to make this final stretch bearable. I feel like even if I moved to another job it wouldn't change things too much. Even if I jumped ship and got a substantial salary increase I'd still need to work at least a few more years, regardless. But I'm just tired of working!

I've read some other posts here on this topic and most of the suggestions won't work for my situation. A common suggestion is to work fewer hours, move down to 30 hours a week even if it pushes back your FI date, but that wouldn't fly in my job/industry. They also wouldn't allow me to take a sabbatical and return to my job later, or some other non-traditional arrangement like that. If I try to move to a job with fewer responsibilities and lower pay, that will just mean I'll have to keep working longer (and lower pay doesn't necessarily mean less stress). If I quit to take some time off then that would just mean burning through my savings while unemployed and then having to return to the rat race anyway at some point in the future, and having to work even longer to make up for the money I spent while not working. 

Is there a better approach than just ""keep your head down and plow through it""? I'm looking for some anecdotes from people who have been through something similar.

financialindependence,I need help/resources for what to do with money for early retirement and passive income.,"Throwaway because I don’t want any financial stuff linked to my main.

My grandpa(75) and I (25m) have been talking back and forth for the past few years on what to do with his money, which will become my inheritance. So far all I’m aware of is around $200k that I’ve seen with my own eyes. He claims it’s upwards of $300k everything included, but that’s neither here nor there. 

We’ve had the money in a CD for the past 3-4 years getting between 3.5-5% interest(we haven’t been compounding it which was probably a bad move), which is what we used to buy and pay off my house and what I’ve used to be able to get a new car. He’s been contemplating on taking it from the CD and trying to invest it in the stock market to get higher yields. I think someone else has been talking to him because he would only mention the S&P500. 

I talked with a trusted friend about it and his FIL has multiple properties he’s bought and done extremely well on so he’s recommended I invest in real estate vs the stock market. The only issues are, I don’t want the liability that comes with real estate and they live in an area with a pop of 200k where I live in an area with a pop of 12k, so it doesn’t seem wise to invest in rental properties to me.

Can anyone give me some kind of resources I can look into and talk with my grandpa about, or give me any insight on what to do with said money?

Im married, we make around $80k gross, my house is paid off, I owe $23k on my car, and I’m investing in both my retirement at work and a 457b account. 

My main goals are to be able to retire at 45 which I can do because I started my job so early in life, be able to provide for my child who is arriving soon, and be able to make AT LEAST what I’m currently making now not counting my retirement or 457b. 

I’m sure these goals seem incredibly lofty, but I have absolutely no clue how any of this works. If you do have any advice then please try to explain it as plainly as possible. I know I’m in my mid 20s, but I never really thought I would be in this position so I never bothered to learn very much about it.",0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gwxhj6/i_need_helpresources_for_what_to_do_with_money/

financialindependence,"36M, ~$1.35M Net Worth, $400K Income, NYC – Am I on the right track for long-term financial independence?","Hey everyone,

I’m looking for feedback and advice on my financial situation and next steps. Here’s the breakdown:
- Age: 36
- Income: ~$400K/year (base, bonus, stock) as a creative director at a top company in NYC.
- Net Worth: ~$1.35M
- Crypto: ~$650K (mostly Bitcoin, decisions that were risky but life-changing).
- Taxable Brokerage: ~$350K (index funds, tech/growth-heavy).
- 401(k): ~$175K.
- Roth IRA: ~$150K (rolled some Roth 401(k) contributions here).
- HSA: ~$15K.
- Background:
I didn’t finish college, but I took continuing education courses and built my career through grit and experience. 15 years ago, I was waiting tables and watching my friends graduate, unsure of my future. Now, I’m proud to say I’m a self-made millionaire, but imposter syndrome is real. I’m working through it in therapy and trying to embrace the unconventional path I’ve taken.
- Spending: ~$100K/year. I’m single but hope to have a family someday. I was engaged two years ago, but it didn’t work out, and I’m just now rebuilding my confidence and starting to date again. I feel behind when I think about marriage and kids, but I remind myself that life isn’t a race.
- Investments:
I know my crypto-heavy portfolio is a liability. I’m not abandoning it, but I want to diversify into other assets (e.g., real estate, dividend stocks). I also wonder whether I should load up on Bitcoin ETFs in tax-advantaged accounts or explore other strategies.
- Career:
I’m earning well but feel burnt out. I’d love to work because I want to, not because I have to, within 10 years. I’m wondering whether I should position myself for Director/VP roles with higher pay or focus on coasting while maintaining work-life balance.

Questions for the Community:
1. Am I on track for financial independence (or even early retirement) in the next 10-15 years with these numbers?
2. Should I diversify away from Bitcoin more aggressively? If so, what are the best asset classes or strategies to explore?
3. Is there a smarter way to leverage my income (e.g., real estate, angel investing, or more in taxable accounts)?
4. With a family in mind, how should I prepare financially for future costs like housing, childcare, and education?
5. Any general feedback on optimizing my strategy or adjusting my mindset?

Thanks in advance for any insights. I’ve come a long way, but I want to make the most of the opportunities I’ve created and position myself for long-term success.",0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gwv49a/36m_135m_net_worth_400k_income_nyc_am_i_on_the/

financialindependence,FIRE housing discussion for DINK 25k take home 1.25M net worth (Singapore),"crossposting from r/singaporefi ($ in SGD, flat = apartment, BUC = building under construction, cpf = government forced retirement savings)

Looking for external no filter comments on what to do with our money. We’re lucky enough to be in a situation where our income far exceeds our needs and lifestyle. Have been invested in FIRE for a long time, and actively saving/investing as much money as possible since we started working >10 years ago. Currently trying to balance options around housing such as continuing to rent, buy a resale flat or buy a BUC condo.

### Details (will expand in comments if asked)

Who: DINK mid-30s \
Jobs: Tech \
Monthly net income (less forecasted tax and cpf): $25,000 \
Rent: $3,000 \
Other expenses: $3,000 \
Monthly ETF-based portfolio contributions: $15,000-20,000 \
Portfolio (ETF, CPF, Cash): $1,250,000 \
Liabilities: $3,000 / month rent

### Background (will expand in comments if asked)

The growth in our portfolio has largely been driven by the markets incredible performance the last 10 years, with the majority of our holdings in NASDAQ. Of course, we can’t discount the incredible savings rate, which was not always the case. We’ve progressed in our careers substantially over the last 10 years which increased our earnings from $8,000 combined to $25,000 combined over a 10 year period.

### Option 1 - Do nothing
Continue investing our substantial left overs on a monthly basis until we reach FIRE accounting for rent into old age. Haven't seriously considered the impact on financials with old age long term care costs.

### Option 2 - Resale Flat
Buy an HDB with cash, depleting investments but securing a long term household into retirement. Cons: Investments are a snowball effect and we would be losing a lot of momentum in future gains. Pros: not treating housing as an investment but rather securing a market independent retirement (rental fluctuations be damned).

### Option 3- Condo BUC
Buy a new build that will TOP in 4 years. Our jobs are fairly secure and income is growing, we can afford to take on additional risk. Cons: depletes investments in the same way that Option 2 does, but extends the hurt into a long tailed mortgage repayment. It also treats housing as an investment which we are vehemently against. Pros: quality of life increases with choice of location, development’s amenities, etc. Into retirement, this is something we would be prioritising however we acknowledge that this option pushes retirement out to a significantly later date.

financialindependence,[MILESTONE UNLOCKED] $1 Million Net Worth,"Just updated our spreadsheet and realized we’ve officially crossed the $1 Million milestone! 🎉 A big part of it is compounding doing its magic and a few solid investment decisions along the way.

**Net Worth Breakdown**: $1,001,129

* Savings/Checking: $23,500
* 401(k)s: $258,319
* Roth IRAs: $15,500
* HSAs: $8,000
* R.E. Net Value (w. Equity): $615,700
* Brokerage: $72,290
* 529: $7,820

**Household Details:**

* Combined income: $261K/year 
* Age: 36
* Lifestyle: Started late on the financial independence journey but ramped it up in recent years. Now maxing out 401(k)s, HSAs, and IRAs annually. A large chunk of our net worth is tied to real estate: our primary home (purchased at a COVID-era rate) and a rental property.

**How Does It Feel?**

Honestly? Not much different. I suspect it’ll feel the same when we hit $2M in the next couple of years. What keeps me motivated is the discipline we’ve built—those habits in good times lay the foundation for weathering the bad ones.

financialindependence,help-weird sudden situation ,"I am 41. Yesterday I hit for what is me financial independence.  Today hit the nail on the head and sealed it.

I am still in a state of shock. This is not a look at me post -instead, I hope someone reads it and give me advice. I consider myself extremely stupid and beyond lucky but a very hard worker. 

This was unexpected. I believed I would be financially independent at 43-44.  I also thought that I would be at 38.   I was just limping towards the finish line (lots of credit cards and personal loans with about three years left). Essentially I'm a crypto guy and I had mstu calls. The majority of the debt is cleared.

What I need help with:

1. I feel like I'm too lucky and at danger of being a lottery winner who blows everything. 

2. My major money plan besides keeping some crypto-which goes against everything I advocate for-was to pay off my rentals so I can get consistent income. Once again, I hate this idea, but I've never been cash flow positive. I've been cash flow negative my entire life.

3. To follow on #1, I feel the danger of extreme envy if I share this with people who I really trust. I fucking worked my ass off for 16 years, but that doesn't mean people won't be envious.

I shared this with one guy and told him 50% of the truth and I didn't like where the convo was going. He was getting pissed. Not happy for me. Pissed. 2 other friends were genuinely happy. These are long term, 10+ year friendships.

Many of my close friends do the same or similar jobs, and/or are in similar places. There is now a wild gulf if they know the truth. Many of them are my age and have relatively little assets. The chance of escaping for them is very low.

4. I have done one indulgence for myself. Besides this, I think the rational move is to to move to a better community. However-we are mortgage free. if we move to a place we want, we would have a substantial mortgage. Which then brings me back to not being free. I think renting is a great value right now but I have PTSD from not being a renter-I rented rooms and was treated like shit. Lived in awful places. 

5. My wife has 2 kids from her first marriage which was full of extreme bad Money issues. Long story short, guy made millions, got millions of equity, and gambled it + lifestyle away. Was making tons of money but was fronting a lifestyle like he was making $600k a year. Lost everything.

I do not want these kids and our future kid to grow up with bad money values. I have seen several families who are raising kids not who are assholes but have delusional concepts of money.

financialindependence,Research on Early Retirement is Grim. What do you make of that?,"Today I looked up research on early retirement.  It looks grim:

* Early retirees, particularly men, face higher rates of anxiety and depression (Buxton et al., 2005)
* Early retirement is associated with greater risk of chronic conditions, like cardiovascular diseases. [link](https://consensus.app/papers/does-retirement-trigger-health-behncke/8681791a7373505dac6028acc38f0914/)
* Retiring very early increases physical limitations in later life. [link](https://consensus.app/papers/does-retirement-impact-functional-limitations-later-life-xu/a75f78da73685e8291872536bc8a3cc7/)
* Loss of professional networks can lead to reduced social interactions and isolation [link](https://consensus.app/papers/causal-effects-retirement-timing-health-calvo/d1e8dd73a5e05ccb8aaede97562fd517/)

And so on.  These are just the top results...  I haven't done a completely thorough review of the literature.  But most of the studies seem to point to negative outcomes.  Many control for obvious causal distortions (e.g. controlling for reverse causation etc).

What do you guys make of this?  I myself am a very early retiree, fairly recently so, and am undecided so far about whether I think it's made my life better or worse overall.

I'd be especially curious to hear from other very early retirees.

*Edit: A lot of comments are focusing on reverse causation: that people in worse conditions are more likely to retire.  Of course that's a good point, and I haven't read every single one of these studies. But the ones I did look at often controlled for that -- e.g. by looking at rates of cognitive decline internal to groups, etc.  If you're a scientist doing research on this stuff, reverse causation is definitely going to occur to you. :)*",0,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gv2pek/research_on_early_retirement_is_grim_what_do_you/
financialindependence,Path of least resistance to FIRE,"Hi all, 

Have been a long time lurker. Need some advice on how to get on the right track for fire in the next 5years. 

Me 37m and wife 35f. DINKWADs. Still not sure about having a child. Combined post tax salaries: $ 200,000 yearly. 

Presently, we are heavy on real estate. 
Prop 1: $625,000 after sale (primary)
Prop 2: $180,000 after sale 
Prop 3: $300,000 after sale. 

~$100k in cash and emergency funds 
$300,000 in retirement accounts. 

Car is paid off and we have a boat that we want to keep. 

Our main issue is although all three of our properties cash flow over $6000 cumulatively, it’s literally eating into our time and it’s a second full time job for us. 

Our plan is to sell our primary right now and move to property 2, make it primary and then sell and move to no.3 and sell that one within the next 3-4 years and make all the money liquid. 

Our post retirement plan is to move to Asia to our home country where we think our expenses with vacations won’t exceed $50,000 a year. Most likely there will be years of less than $25,000. We have a family home and cottage that we will only have to pay for maintaining. 

The question: 

We want to some ideas on what we should do with the cash that comes out of the properties? We have high risk tolerance for now as we love our jobs and wouldn’t mind working part time after and full time if needs be. 

Our net-worth presently is very real estate heavy because that was what we knew best in the situation and we made the most of it. 

But we want to get out of managing properties and airbnbs and do something more hands off. 

I would love someone to point me in the right direction for options… would be happy to get some links where we can read up on what we should do, any ideas, any concepts that we could employ to get to FIRE in the next 5-6 years. 

Thank you

Edit: 

Monthly around 17k of which we spend 8k because we travel a lot and eat out when needed. The boat + recreation is a major expense + sending money to parents back home. Our primary is a triplex so the basement and upstairs rent pays off the mortgage and utilities. 

The rest, we are slowly investing into safe etfs and thinking of going into airbnb arbitrage. (Bought some PLTR, VT, LUNR and VV. Didn’t think much just bought. 

The boat will go with us. We will sail it to Asia and the expense there is minimal to keep and maintain with cheap labor and mooring fee is literally $50 a year. ",49,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gtkzey/path_of_least_resistance_to_fire/

$4,150 /mo (non taxable) VA Disability P&T.  

Monthly spend averages $7,500 with $10,500 being the highest spend month this year.  

I max out 401K and spouse maxes out her SEP-IRA.  Non-retirement investments vary, depending on home improvement projects, solar that was just paid off, travel, etc.  Both cars are 2023 and paid off.  

No additional debt.  TriCare covers health for next to nothing.  Our monthly ‘frivolous’ spend is probably pretty high and would need to be cut down.  Our tax bill is pretty hefty; we could move to a LCOL state or even a more veteran friendly state, but….   

I want to retire ASAP, ideally no later than 45 at which point I’d work more leisurely, pick up hobbies, go back to college (Post 9/11 MGIB).   We also want to stay in San Diego, close to family as they start to age and potentially require our help.

financialindependence,Taking an indefinite break,"Hello FI community, first ever Reddit post (been lurking here for a couple years) so not exactly a throwaway account.

Sharing my story in case it’s interesting or spurs some ideas. I don’t have a lot of questions but welcome any feedback, guidance, additional perspectives, etc.

TL;DR: Approaching 40, 3 kids; planning to leave a job I enjoy to take a break; Roughly 5% WR currently with some debatable math. Long post following – I tried to start with the most relevant stuff for the group.

Huge thank you to the experts here who’ve shared so much knowledge, and those who’ve shared their personal experience on the journey. Insights on ACA, college funding, psychological considerations, withdrawal rates, and asset allocation have been incredibly helpful.

**Family and Financial Details:**

M39, have 3 kids aged 7 and younger with my wife (40) in MCOL area.

Wife left the workforce a few years ago; I have a director-level role in large Corp.

Estimate annual expenses (allotting for home repairs at 1% and a small amount for car maintenance) to be about $60k without vacations, $70-80k with. $12k of this is Mortgage Principal which I am inclined to think about as asset rebalancing rather than an actual expense (I know this is an atypical viewpoint).

Base is roughly $170k (spent most of my career below $100k but got a massive raise in 2022). bonuses have been meager lately but hoping for 30-40k this year as company has had a good year.

Expect to take a 3+ month break next year with roughly 1.4M NW (\~1.1M liquid). I’ll have a CD ladder paying out most of monthly expenses and a NQDC plan that will kick in afterwards for several years (planning for about $25k per year but subject to market conditions – this is included in NW estimate above).

We both grew up in working-class families and are fairly frugal – we have a nice home, but otherwise have some aversion to spending a lot of money (I used to believe this was a good thing – now I think it’s probably a mixed bag).

 **Main Problems:**

1. My biggest issue is that I am time-poor. Although I WFH and I manage to squeeze in an hour for exercise several days a week, I typically have only about an hour for me time each evening by which point I’m too mentally exhausted to make great use of it. 

 1a: All of our kids are pretty feral by nature, especially my oldest who’s got severe ADHD. There’s not really any downtime when they’re awake – they’re getting into stuff, fighting, etc. We don’t get a ton of family help, though I am very grateful for the in-laws who live close by. Overall, it feels like every day is a grind and that we’ve got the resources to make it more enjoyable, so it seems silly not to.

While we eat pretty healthy, all the food prep is quick stuff – raw or microwaved veggies, PB&J, yogurt, etc. We’re basically just scrambling to make it through each day and not getting enough sleep.

1b: I don’t have time for my interests, especially socializing with other adults away from screaming kids. I’m not sure how RE will solve the social concern, but at least I can make time for daytime hobbies.

2. I feel like I should spend more time with my kids while I can, and that I will regret it if I don’t. I want to be a great dad, but I am shorter and more distracted with the kids than I would like. This is more of a “should” than a “want” right now but I expect the fun level to improve if other stressors decrease.

3. While my job has a lot of positives, I am ultimately sitting in front screens for 8-9 hours every day, spending my efforts as a cog in the economic wheel. I’m also not sure that WFH is really benefitting my happiness – though after moving I’d have a 40-minute commute each way if we are ever forced to go back, which wouldn’t work with family obligations.

I enjoy the day to day, the problems to solve, the people I work with etc. My only complaint aside from the time commitment is the sitting.

**Solution:**

**Part 1: Sabbatical / Mini-Retirement**

I am planning to take a few months off minimum. I’ll ask about the possibility of unpaid leave but am not counting on it being an option. Plenty of ideas, no firm plans yet but will likely be a mix of traveling, more socializing, and being outdoors.

**Part 2: Transition to Coasting**

I expect I will be doing some amount of work (perhaps volunteering) for at least the next 10 years – though maybe my views will change with the break.

Since we are nearly FI and I don’t need a lot of income, I am hoping that when I return from the break, I find something to do with several of these features, maybe through self-employment or contracting:

1.       Part time – 20 hours max

2.       Seasonal – 3 to 6 months per year working

3.       Involves a decent amount of walking

4.       Provides some “Capital P Purpose” – Doing something that really matters to me

Paradoxically, I am interested in getting more into AI / Machine Learning either as a hobby or future “career”. I’ve got some basic Python skills but spent my career in business and data roles.

**Healthcare:**

I am hoping there are no substantive changes to the ACA / subsidies in the next few years, as my wife has a long-term condition that makes us dependent on good insurance.

With the current rules, I expect to manage income via a combination of Roth Conversions to stay off Medicaid, Taxable Brokerage Withdrawals, and low expenses. If I my post-break work ends up earning too much for max subsidies, I guess that’s a good problem to have!

**College:**

We have some funds in a 529, but am counting on showing a low enough income to qualify for whatever’s available. I paid for my own college and grad school, though I get it’s much more expensive now

**Fears:**

1.  Will we run out of money? Will some catastrophe happen with our health or the economy? Will I become unemployable?

I know these are all just feelings to manage.. Right now, my commitment to the goal outweighs the fear.

2. What if I don’t find what I’m looking for on returning, and I’ve essentially thrown aside this great job? Will I regret it if I’m in a slightly worse role, probably earning less?

I don’t have a great sense for the odds that this comes true. I’d like to think it’s a low probability but it is a consideration.

 3. What if the break fails to help me solve the problems outlined above? Should I have a more solid plan going into it?

 I’m certain that I’ll be more active, but whether the quality of my presence improves with the quantity is something I’ll have to be intentional about. I also don’t know how I’m going to find more time to be with friends but am hopeful that the occasional nights out become less of a burden on my wife if I am taking more of the childcare responsibilities.

4. General anxiety about jumping into the unknown, taking a different path than everyone I know in real life, and just a general fear of “failing” – whatever that means.

In some ways, I think work is the opiate of the masses in American culture. It’d be easier to ignore the existential questions and keep working for money, getting the ego boost of a nice income, job title, etc. even though I know that none of these are “core values” and that they won't solve the dissonance I've been feeling.

**Interests and Ideas:**

Spend the summer traveling around the US – lots of time in national parks, exploring small towns, trying different things with the family.

Maybe we can find a house for the summer near a beach and I can become a passable surfer.

Perhaps I’ll dedicate a few hours a day to get really good at a few boardgames and try to earn a medal at the World Boardgaming Championships.

Several years ago, I attended a mediation course with the intent on testing the waters for a possible career switch. The promised volunteer opportunities never materialized but the idea of getting some experience and starting a practice intrigues me.

I may try to get into something more technical that allows for some learning and growth – I see part-time ML opportunities like Omdena and others. Maybe I’ll look into app development and pursue some ideas.

 **Other Notes:**

I’ve been building up a bond tent this year – am currently about 49%/34%/17% US equities / International Equities /CDs.  I probably should have figured out how to buy TBills or whatever but figured the time required to understand it wasn’t worth the difference in returns vs CDs.

I currently have about $150k in taxable equities and another $70k in the NQDC plan. I am debating how much to contribute in 2025 – there’s probably a non-zero chance that upon having the discussion I’m let go before my intended retire date.. I imagine the chance is pretty small but if I’m deferring 50-75%, any unemployment benefits would be a lot smaller if I understand the way benefits are determined.

Finally, thanks to recommendations from folks on here, I’ve found some content on the podcasts “The Rational Reminder” and “Retire Often” that really resonates with me. Individual episodes are hit or miss for me, but there are plenty of gems.",92,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gst22i/taking_an_indefinite_break/
financialindependence,Alternative suggestions on proper allocation for retirement (not 60/40),"So I realize that many people advocate for a 60/40 split of stocks/bonds in retirement.  My main problem with this approach is that in my case I have about $7m net worth not including principal residence (no mortgage) and I require about $120k/yr for expenses.  My withdrawal rate is under 2% and if I were to de-risk from the 8% I currently have in bond/cash all the way to 40%, this would 2.8m.  That would fund 23 years of drawdown just from the bond/cash portion.  Even the worst market crashes in history wouldn't require this type of safety as far as I know. I was thinking having 5 years or so of expenses held in bonds/cash would be enough to mitigate any sort of downturn. Am I missing something or does that sound reasonable?

EDIT: 
Thanks for the helpful responses. 
So to add some more info that may be pertinent, I am just turning 50 and thinking about retiring in the next year or two since both my kids will finally be in college. As some of you have pointed out, I realize I am overly risk adverse and that has to do with my upbringing and the fact that I had very little growing up. 
I like the idea of building in more giving into my budget since I am pretty comfortable with the $120k spend. I mean, I could always spend more but I’m not sure it would bring any measurable increase in happiness. I’ll probably leave a certain amount behind for my kids but in the words of Buffet want to “give them enough to do anything, but not so much that they’ll do nothing.”",4,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gt7kkz/alternative_suggestions_on_proper_allocation_for/

financialindependence,Rent vs. Buy w/o Mortgage,"**TL;DR** \- we're blessed. We have the option to buy a home with cash. Considering that it'd likely be a better financial move to rent, are having trouble weighing the pros and cons. Would love to crowdsource some opinions!

First, some numbers:

* $1.8M NW (all taxable, non-taxable accounts, and cash accounts)
* \~$850k home equity, mortgage free
* No other debt

Yes, my family is very blessed! I owe a lot of our financial plan over the past decade to the wisdom from subreddits like this. Thank you all for your continued discussions.

We are looking to move. We don't enjoy where we live, and want to be much closer to family, particularly while we have such young children. We need a village.

Based on list and rent prices in our target location, renting would be only slightly cheaper MoM. However, our monkey wrench of privilege into the decision is that we will pay cash, and we are intending to downsize, so mortgage rate doesn't really matter. We will likely get 850-900k from our home sale, and then purchase a home between 600-800k. Mortgage rates inflating monthly payments is often a *huge* factor when considering renting vs. buying purely from a financial perspective.

We're estimating that rent would be between 3-4k / mo. If we dumped 850k into our taxable investments (VTSAX baby), we should expect between 7-10% YoY, or around $60k/yr on the average-low end. With rents showing between 2500-4000, on the high end, we stand to spend $48k/yr on rent, so we could be saving \~$12k/yr by renting. However, factoring the non-mortgage costs of home ownership, like maintenance, property tax, and home insurance, the difference is even more dramatic! Ballpark estimations hows we could save an additional 10-15k yr.

From a pure numbers perspective, it doesn't appear that buying would ever catch up to renting. But, the area we're looking in has experienced massive growth in the past 5 years, like many areas, so there's the possibility it *does* outperform renting. Conversely, the stock market is at an ATH, and we're still riding one of the longest and largest bull markets in history. Selling a massive, tangible asset, investing in the stock market, and potentially watching it tumble so much, would be gut wrenching. Not that SWR calculations don't account for this, but it's worth considering.

Another financial considering is income manipulation. Currently, our investment mix would allow us to live relatively freely while keeping reported income very low, leading to all sorts of subsidies, like the ACA and eventually financial aid for our children. Renting would inflate our fixed expense each year, inflating our income potentially by $50k+, and pushing us out of subsidy range. I know this is a touchy subject in the FIRE community, like why would we even consider subsidies with this much money, but I digress.

Other considerations here are purely lifestyle related. We have small children, and would love to put down roots for 15-20 years to give them a stable, familiar childhood home. We both came from a childhood home that our parents are even still in, so visiting for holidays is incredible. We also really don't enjoy moving, so the thought of a landlord kicking us out on a whim is scary. Lastly, the idea of a landlord sticking us with a huge yearly rent increase, likely well past beyond inflation and other home ownership cost increases, is also scary.

Any thoughts or wisdom? Has anyone been in this situation, and if so, what did you decide?",17,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gs194v/rent_vs_buy_wo_mortgage/

financialindependence,From broke cab driver to $1 Million NW in less than 10 years,"Long time lurker here, just wanted to say I appreciate this sub and all of you who contribute to this great community.

I just set up Fidelity Full View yesterday and realized our NW crossed the $1 Million mark recently.

**Background:**

First generation immigrants, came over from Europe at 21 from the same country, but we met here.

39M married to my better half, one toddler and another one on the way.

$850 invested in FXAIX + Bonds (80/20)

$200k primary home equity

  
About 10 years ago I was driving a cab in Chicago at night while finishing my bachelors in Computer Science. I was about $50k in debt, and got to the point where I was using the 0% APR checks from credit cards for daily expenses. Around the same time I met my wife and had a very modest wedding with close friends.

**Progress throughout the years:**

For the first few years I focused on paying off debt. I also supported my wife through college and managed to contribute a little bit to my 401k every year.

About 5 years ago I discovered the FIRE movement and resonated with it. Growing up with limited resources in a 3rd world country, it wasn't hard to maintain a frugal lifestyle. My wife is also frugal and doesn't really value material possessions. She is a foodie and avid traveler.

In the last 5 years we have managed to save on average about 100k each year in pretax + taxable accounts.

We also managed to purchase a home, renovate it and currently have about $200k equity in it.

Btw, r/churning helped save us thousands each year in travel costs.

After seeing the number on the screen yesterday, I got emotional and shed a few tears since we've been working on this for so many years, and it was a huge mental milestone. I felt some of the financial burden taken off my shoulders, and I can finally think about slowing down.

I don't think we would have been able to achieve this milestone in such a short period of time (or ever) in our home country, and this is proof of the crazy upward mobility in the US compared to other countries.

**What's next:**

We are thinking about coasting in a few years, with extended summers in Europe with the kids, but our plans are flexible.

I am so grateful for the support of my wife and the fact that she balances me out every day, reminding me that there are things in life that are much more important than money.

It feels weird that I can only share this milestone with my wife and a bunch of strangers on the internet, but I am grateful for all of you.",132,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1grgxud/from_broke_cab_driver_to_1_million_nw_in_less/
financialindependence,Pay medical expenses with HSA or transfer it to personal checking account when going on Medicare?,"So, my Medicare coverage begins on December 1st, due to having a rare aggressive cancer and having been receiving SSDI for 2 years.  I'm 53 years old.

My husband and I are currently on COBRA with the insurance I had before I became disabled.  I have an Optum bank HSA.  My husband has not wanted to sock money away into the HSA, so it's been challenging to get him to want to max it out.

He would like to just close the HSA when I have become ineligible to contribute to it in 2 weeks.

I currently have $1800 in it and have another $1900 to contribute to the account to reach my maximum allowed for the year.

I'm confused as to the difference of paying eligible medical expenses out of my HSA, or just transferring it to my personal checking account and paying them out of that.

In other words, should I just close my HSA after I've contributed the rest of my maximum amount.  I easily have the medical expenses to close it out with as I'm still on chemotherapy, and have had COBRA premiums of $1600 each month this year.

I know he won't want to take the risk on investing any of it, so how could I justify keeping it in there to pay for medical expenses?  We make over $150,000 per year and he owns businesses which means he itemizes deductions.

Please explain the answer in simple terms so I can explain to him why/if we should keep the $3700 in the account to pay for upcoming expenses, in the coming year when I'm on Medicare.

financialindependence,Create a token solo 401k and plan to roll over my current employer's 403b to the solo 401k when I leave that employer?,"Hello,

I had a light dribble of self employment income this year. $125. I want to open a Solo 401(k) (hopefully with Fidelity) then make an employer side ""profit sharing"" contribution of 20% i.e. $25.

financialindependence,I am at 600k net worth and I also have a GI bill. This is making me rethink some things.,"I remember long ago when I was a broke early 20-something year old, 600k was my ""retirement level money"" (for my standards back then). It's actually unnerving to have this much now.

My FI goals used to be $2 million, and now it's $5 million. Having 600k now makes that 5mil feel more attainable.

It also makes me think of what I want in life if I had lots and lots of money. At 600k I am way past the point where I worry about eating or rent for the next couple months. I feel like I can't tell anyone about my situation and fortune, [even my wealthier-than-me upper middle class relatives were not happy for me and that was a big lesson in ""you never know""](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/r0wzis/vent_i_regret_telling_my_relative_how_much_money/). I had some questionable childhood friends with bad attitudes who treated me badly and took me for granted, and honestly having money helped give me the confidence to walk away even if it meant being alone for a while. They were resentful of my money and living situation, even though they grew up in nicer households than I did and had colleges and cars paid for. I am no longer their poor ugly friend.

I've wanted to go back to the military, and surprisingly at this point, I am having doubts about it simply due to the lifestyle and differences in values with people I met in the military. Since separating and living off my small income (with the assurance that I have my savings to back me up if I get desperate), I've lived a very stress-free life, had time and space to breathe, had time to prioritize medical care and therapy, and lost a lot of weight back to my teenage weight and more muscle mass. Better clothes and appearance. Better living situation, safer neighborhood. Surprisingly, people back at the military base picked up on this and people who used to ignore me and shit talk me started facebook stalking me and trying to become my friends. This makes me aware that I need to be cognizant about stuff like this and that people talk. Even if I ""dress down"", people can tell. They just know by the vibe. They see you. I wonder if I will even blend in anymore.

I can use the GI bill to gun for the best and well-connected school possible, if they will let me in. No matter the price. I have a bachelor's already and can score two master's, while pocketing and investing the stipend for even more money.

I don't want to fuck this up.",0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gscik0/i_am_at_600k_net_worth_and_i_also_have_a_gi_bill/

financialindependence,"Is it possible to FIRE with a decent quality of life if you're not a high earner, but very frugal?","I often lurk the financial subs, and I see that most people frequenting them are in the higher tax brackets than I, but their savings level is very low. I'm curious how far I can get by frugalness alone.

I'm 26, and I make $47k per year, before taxes. I have no degree that would afford me a better-paying job, and to be honest, I have neither the passion for any of the particular fields that would pay better, nor the motivation to actually go to college.

My ultimate goal is to buy a house/property that would cost about $600k.

By year's end, I will have over $75k in savings. I save a significant portion of my money. Year to date, I have so far saved 63% of my income, and this is after taking a month off of work to get married, go on vacation, get an airbnb, etc. 

I have zero debt. I pay $500/mo for rent, + perhaps $320/mo or so on other required expenses, such as food, utilities, car gas, etc. I started a Roth IRA two years ago, and I will max it out every Jan 1st going forward. At current spending and income levels, I save $21-24k per year, depending on outlier variables. 

Can it be done? Or do I really have to force myself back into college?",139,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gqtql2/is_it_possible_to_fire_with_a_decent_quality_of/
financialindependence,Reducing volatility and increasing SWR,"This seems counter intuitive, so I'm trying to wrap my head around it.

Let's say i have 2 scenarios.  The first is one where the person has $5M with a 65/35 split, retiring immediately.  In the second scenario, they buy 20 years of cash flow via a TIPS ladder.  Let's say they pay $2M for that and the resulting $3m is invested now a little more aggressively at 80/20 (since we now have 20 years of income).

Clearly, the TIPS path is the safer and less volatile path.  However, the surprising thing is that it also gives me higher median ending values (in a constant dollar scenario) or higher available yearly spend (in variable models).  I'm getting similar results across multiple tools.

Do you all have some insight into how it can be both safer/less volatile and have a higher median ending value at the same time?

Update:  One idea is that since, in my model, the 80/20 split persists even after the 20 years ends, this pushes the expected return higher.  If I bring it down to 65/35, the results are similar to the base model.  It seems I need a tool that allows a change in allocation midway through retirement.",14,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gqz566/reducing_volatility_and_increasing_swr/

financialindependence,The Car Buying Dilemma,"
To buy or not to buy, what to buy, how much to buy. I am now facing this dilemma. 

Is this a bad decision considering my goal of being work optional by 45?

I REALLY want a new car. I don’t need one. I want an AWD SUV so I can drive off-road and in the snow (which I do often during ski season, right now I rent one for ski trips as I cannot legally drive my RWD coupe due to traction requirements) and for more room if I ever have a family.

I found a nice used car, 3 years old, generally reliable, and sporty for 41K. It’s perfect. It’s also used.

My current car is worth 10-14K; 2K loan. That means I would like have to pay: 
- 10K down 
- 4K in taxes and fees
- 1K to ship to me
- Total Out Of Pocket: 15K (10K from sale of my car)
- 30K loan @5.5% = ~575/month

Is this a bad decision considering my goal of being work optional by 45?

My financial profile:
Age: 28
Annual Income: ~140K
Net Worth: 223K
- 100K in Retirement
- 73K in Taxable Investments
- 30K House Fund
- 20K Emergency Fund
- 2K car loan

financialindependence,What more can I be doing? Road to $1m,"UPDATE:  Want to thank everyone for their comments.  It really helped open our eyes that are biggest problem was budget.  We sat down and hammered out a detailed budget.  We found we had $2-$3k/month going to food, drinks, shopping, sports betting, just random stuff.   Based on our current plans now, we can continue to save at a higher rate that should get us close to $1mm in 7-10 years.  We are also going to aggressively pay off the car and start looking at new houses at a much lower price point.  Thank you all! Very inspiring! 

  
TLDR:  Sit down and make a budget!!!



Late starter in life but caught up quickly.  Married, 40 yrs old.  Total savings:

401ks - $160k

Roth IRA - $15k

Investment Account - $55k (saving this up for a home purchase)

Home Equity - $75k

Combined Gross Income - $325k annually

Current Debt:  $20k on a car loan

UPDATE Budget - $1k/month on mortgage, $500/car payment, $400/month on internet, phones, and subscriptions, $1000 on food, drinks, fun.  As I am typing this.... we need to budget things better.

I maxed out my 401k and started doing a mega back door roth this year that my employer offers.  I have an aggressive goal to get to $1m in savings and retirement by 50 years old.  We've been blessed to be able to contribute about 30-35% of our income to savings and honestly we could do more.  We do plan on buying a new house which will increase our current mortgage payment 3-4x (current mortage is only $1k/month).  We live in a ""medium"" cost of living state.   I don't want to retire early but would like to start slowing down substantially by 55.

What are some ideas to continue to super charge savings?  Investment property, switch more to the mega back door roth after I hit the company match on the 401k?  Just not sure if I am doing the right mix currently.",44,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gqgley/what_more_can_i_be_doing_road_to_1m/

financialindependence,Cash vs equity: What's the ideal asset mix for a 5-10 year mini-retirement?,"I'm in my early 30s, planning to quit my office job and try my luck at a risky passion career, like writing, being a DJ, or content creation.

If it doesn't work out after \~7 years, I'll go back to a normal job.

With these kinds of careers, it's almost guaranteed that you'll have no income for years. Even if you eventually succeed. And of course for most people it never works out.

I don't have enough money to never have to work again, but I do have enough to sustain my lifestyle for 15+ years.

So here's my plan:

1. Quit my job
2. Travel for a couple months
3. Try my luck at \[the risky career thing\] for X years
   * X will be **between 5 and 10 years**—haven't decided yet
4. After X years:
   * Am I making a living with this new career? → **Success!**
   * Still not making enough money? → Go back to normal job

Initially, I was planning to keep **X \* {yearly cost of living}** as cash (and invest the rest in global index funds).

But now I'm thinking that I probably don't need *that* much cash.

For example, if I plan on having no income for (worst case) **X = 7 years**, then I could keep **Y = 4 years** of burnrate in cash, and invest the other 3.

Idea being: if I invest that other 3 years worth of burnrate, that in investment is most likely profitable 4 years from now.

But there's also the risk that it *isn't* profitable. In that case, in 4 years from now I'll either have to:

1. Sell ETFs at a loss to keep the mini-retirement going
2. Quit the mini-retirement early

The lower I set Y, the larger the probability that I'll run out of cash while my investments are under water.  
The higher I set Y, the less efficient my portfolio gets with all that cash.

How much cash would you hold on to in my situation? And how would that decision depend on whether it's for 5, 7, or 10 years?

Most FIRE articles and financial models are about end of life retirement.

But how should one rationally make a decision like this?

financialindependence,Are you delaying Social Security till 70?,"According to the NYTimes today, ""People get just 70 percent of their full Social Security benefit if they claim at 62, the full benefit at 67 and 124 percent of the benefit if they claim at 70.

Are you all delaying or planning on delaying SS till 70?  If not, any reason why not, that you would care to share. 

Edit:  Thank you so much to everyone who replied, I read through most of the replies and learnt so much about SS.  As someone not close to SS, I just assumed everyone in this community would take SS at 70, based on the math and their savings.  I am glad I asked, so I know now, how wrong I was in that assumption.

**A Few Updates & Observations Since We Hit $1 Million 3 Years Ago:**

* A few months after hitting our $1 million milestone in 2021, we bought a house in the suburbs and moved out of our small condo in the city. Did a pretty massive whole-house renovation. Our expenses have gone up significantly, but man, we love it here. Best decision we've ever made. 
* We kept the condo as a rental property for 3 years and recently sold it. It was solidly cash flow positive and we had a great tenant in it the entire time, but still not worth the hassle IMO. Sold it for a nice profit once our tenant moved out.
* Weird seeing our investments go down significantly in 2022 due to the stock market downturn. Net worth still managed to stay flat due to aggressive savings and home appreciation.
* In hindsight, buying our ""forever"" home in 2021 with a 4% interest rate has been an OP cheat code. Home appreciation has been an unexpected tailwind for our net worth.
* Stock market in 2023 was crazy. Stock market in 2024 has been bonkers. I genuinely don't understand how it works. Doesn't make sense.
* Had a baby earlier this year. She's the freaking best. Having kids once you are financially, emotionally, and mentally ready is amazing. Highly recommend.
* After baby arrived, wife quit her great six figure job to be a stay-at-home mom. Another one of the best decisions we've ever made. Happiness > Money.
* The decisions that we've made over the last 10 years have set us up so well. We now have the luxury to step back from our careers and focus on our family, which was our plan all along. 

Feel free to ask me any questions you may have about our life or FIRE journey.

financialindependence,FIRE Progression Update: Hit $2M Net worth (Age 43),"Hello everyone,

With the recent market uptick after election, found out my net worth crossed $2 Million. Since there is no one else to share the update with (except my spouse), thought would post here in this community, as my original post from early 2021 on becoming an immigrant millionaire was well received here. Took almost 4 years from $1M mark to $2M.

  
**Net Worth History:**

[Link to Net Worth History](https://imgur.com/a/tPOGLeV)

Has been tracking and saving part of monthly paychecks since 2007 (but no investments due to being afraid of losing principal), but eventually started investing in the market since 2014. Median salary during this period has been $120K working in IT industry and MCOL area. This will be the first year where my salary will cross over a tad above $200K.

Current annual expense is around $75K for a family of 3 (Single earner). We live a pretty low key life style and do not keep up with the Joneses. Only debt is the mortgage on our home  (under $380K balance as of today). As the interest rate is sub 3%, going to leave it as-is until the full 30 years, but have a specific brokerage account to invest the excess principal payments for home pay-off if needed. (Presently sitting around $120K and keeps on adding every month). Drives a 5 year old used SUV paid in cash.

**FIRE Plan:**  
Looking to work for 7 more years to pull the plug and exit the rat race at age 50. Aspired FIRE target is around $3.5M to $4M (in-between), to have a yearly draw of 120K to 140K during retirement years. These are upper bounds considering inflation, healthcare costs, travel plans, college tuition for kid, and any other unknowns.

**Asset Distribution:**

[Link to Asset Distribution](https://imgur.com/a/BCF94vn)

Presently my assets are skewed on index funds, and a few individual tech stocks I which I used to invest heavily on 10 years back. Some of them luckily rallied during the last decade's bull run and became MAG 7. Cut down almost all of the individual losers, and slowly started liquidating the winners to move them to index funds in the last couple of years, but being cautious due to tax implications. Planning to keep on re-balancing over the next few years. Goal is to also increase on bonds and other similar low risk assets into the mix as well for capital preservation, while not losing out to inflation.

**Advice to new FIRE aspirants:**

* Live below your means; Always save a portion of your pay check
* Invest early and often in low cost index funds, and let compounding do its magic
* Have a yearly budget and stick to it. Review and update the budget on a yearly basis
* Don't be afraid to invest the money in the market. You are losing out on opportunity cost and inflation just keeping it in a savings account.
* Keep track of your net worth. It will be a good motivation.
* Do not try to pick and choose individual stocks, and try to beat the market. It's not worth your time over the long run.

financialindependence,Any younger high earners doing roth 401k?,"Ive read a couple comments and threads here and know it’s against conventional wisdom…  but curious if any high earners with a 30+ year time horizon to RMDs are considering or contributing to a roth 401k?

i’m starting to do my own projections and if investment returns are anywhere near historical average, we will not have a much lower AGI than today.  

we have no backdoor roth available and are maxing all preferential tax treatment options (401k, hsa, backdoor roth’s for both of us). 

A couple reasons are I do like the idea of getting more money invested and an after tax dollar is more than a pretax dollar (and since we’re maxing other tools and would continue to max them, this seems reasonable).  Also the recognition that barring something major, we’re not likely to have less income means we likely won’t be in a significantly lower tax bracket.   Finally, i was a bit late to the roth party and investments with roth treatment make up less than 7% of our total investable assets.

Curious for any others who have debated this to chime in.",37,162,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gp3f6e/any_younger_high_earners_doing_roth_401k/
financialindependence,Asset allocation and Variable Percentage Withdrawal,"I plan to implement Variable Percentage Withdrawal (VPW) in retirement.  It fundamentally makes more sense to me to live on less proportionate to a dip in the stock market than it does to stay the course on withdrawing a certain amount, at the risk of exhausting one's portfolio.

Analyses based on VPW really have me questioning traditional asset allocations in retirement.  Investing 35% of a portfolio in bonds instead of stocks would serve to ""dampen"" the fluctuation of the portfolio, and thus would lessen the impact of a downmarket.  For instance, for such a porfolio, if the market dipped by half, then the portfolio should dip by around one-third.

But one's VPW withdrawal trajectory is also less under a more conservative portfolio than it would for a portfolio that is, say, 90% stocks.  So it seems to me that the question is simply whether one would be okay under a huge market downturn.  It seems to me that the ""insurance"" of a more diversified portfolio is relatively expensive, as it comes at the cost of maximizing the returns that could be expected for a portfolio over the length of the decumulation period.

What am I missing here?  Is diversification really just for (i) those who sleep better at night if their portfolio is less volatile, or (ii) those who would be unable to survive the decreased withdrawal during years when there is a historic market downturn?

Thoughts appreciated.  I want to make sure that I am challenging the thinking, because obviously, it is an important issue.  ",14,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gp5l9s/asset_allocation_and_variable_percentage/
financialindependence,Quit job or wait it out?,"NW: well north of $7M, though nearly all of it in taxable accounts, with less than $1M in 401k (mistakes were made, I never used mega backdoor until last year). 

Losing any interest in work and it’s only a matter of time before I lose my job for not doing any work. 

Should I just quit?  The only thing keeping me at work is healthcare and the hope I’ll get a large severance if I can achieve getting myself laid off. 

The daily grind is boring and I fiddling around in excel working or not working basically is a rounding error - assuming 10% market performance in 8 years I’ll have either $15M if I retire and spend $75k a year, vs $16M if I keep working and save $100k a year.  

That’s …. almost nothing?  I just don’t have any motivation for work, especially as I’ve burned out working long hours in the past couple years. 

Thinking I should quit for mental health and then maybe on my own time find a job that interests me. 

Or spend more time with family and my young daughter. 

Tax is also very advantageous to simply not work - I’ll be able to finally sell my stocks that are nearly all capital gains at very low tax rates if I’m not working.

financialindependence,Tax in Retirement,"I am set to retire next year. I have approximately $1.5m in retirement accounts. 40% in a Roth IRA of which 100% invested in equities. 40% in a Traditional IRA of which 20% invested in equities and 20% in Short term bonds. 20% in a brokerage account of which 50% in Equities and 50% in Cash. The current 3 buckets equal a 70/20/10% allocation.

The 10% cash in the brokerage is producing about $7,500 in interest income.(taxable). My question is does it make sense to shift the cash into the tax deferred account and all equities in the brokerage maintaining the 70/20/10 split thus making the income from cash tax deferred? Would it make sense to draw from the brokerage account by selling equities? (My spouse and I would draw approximately $80,000 from social security and we would need to draw an additional $40,000 from retirement accounts. We will both be 70ys old.)

financialindependence,Would love to hear what y'all suggest I do differently with my current breakdown - if anything!,"Have been reading on here a lot lately and am wondering if I am missing some things or opportunity, or maybe validation that what I am doing is the right path.

I currently make around $275k and have been increasing my salary drastically over the last few years starting in 2019.

2019 - $75k

2020 - $105k

2021 - $155k

2022 - $220k

2023 - $250k

2024 - $275k pace

This is my first year of maxing out my 401k due to making some dumb NFT investments, but also purchasing a condo (2020) and a home (2022) as well as a good chunk of travel and a wedding recently, and my current breakdown looks like this:

Checking Account - $20k (for monthly spend; mortgage, car payment, other bills, etc.)

HYSA - $36k (6 months of spend savings, rainy day fund)

Roth IRA - $30k (will go back to maxing out every year - took a few years off from that)

401k - $85k (first year maxing out was this year and goal is to do so going forward)

HSA - $10k (recently started this and have maxed out the last 2 years)

BTC & ETH in Coinbase - $10k (a mix between both, which are the only crypto I purchase) 

Brokerage - $60k (a good chunk of VOO, but also a portfolio I have created myself which is up 45% YTD and is compromised of be chip stocks)

My Condo is now a rental, which we profit $750 per month on, that account has $4,500 in it, and the monthly payment is $2,000.

I have around $2,000 in cash in a safe at home.

I know this part sounds very stupid, but a good chunk of NFTs that are worth currently probably in the low $2,000 - $5,000 range, and at one point on the high, a number that I rather not share in written -- but it was a fantastic learning moment as to not be greedy/dumb and take profits when you can.

And also a good chunk of equity in 2 different start ups that hopefully turn into something in a few years.

Question -- what else should I be doing? I am maxing out 401k, Roth, and HSA each year, and putting the rest (around $4,500 each month) into my brokerage account. Am I missing something or is this the right track to be on?

financialindependence,Role of crypto (BTC) in portfolio on road to FI?,"Wondering how folks in the FI community are generally viewing the role of crypto (primarily BTC) in a portfolio for those trying to achieve FI? I know this can be a controversial topic, but I feel likely I’m increasingly seeing people who are in the $500k-2M NW range having some allocation to crypto. There may be some correlation there given the performance of BTC over the last decade, but it does seem that higher NW individuals are allocating some % of their portfolio to crypto and that is becoming a more mainstream strategy especially with the ETF release earlier this year.

My personal opinion is that a ~10% allocation to BTC seems reasonable. It seems to me like BTC is here to stay and while past performance isn’t indicative of future returns, a small position in BTC can be a way to accelerate your FI journey. This obviously comes with additional risk compared to the classic stock market index fund strategy. But for someone in their 30’s with a good income who is looking for some upside, it seems like a reasonable bet to make.    

Are other folks on the road to FI considering this, or are most people still sticking with the index fund strategy? Curious in this community’s view on this.

financialindependence,"Laid off this past week, maybe CoastFIRE, maybe not. How to move forward?","Hello fellow seekers of financial freedom.  I was laid off this past week, deep into my FI journey and could use some perspective.  The ""surplusing"" wasn't entirely surprising. While a historically high performer at work, my VP and major supporter of my professional development left the business in May and the guy who took over is someone I've butt heads with over the years and I've known this as a highly likely result since that time.  So it goes, but that's part of the beauty of pursuing FI, afterall.

We were up until this point, a dual income household in our early 40s with 3 kids in grade school/middle school.  My wife works part time up to 20hrs/wk, take home of $80k or so/yr 1099 style (no bennies, pretax).  I was making around $220k/yr after bonus and what not.  Now I make zero!  We've got a networth of around $2.6MM, about $1.8MM of which is not home equity.  No other debt other than our 2.75% mortgage with about $455k left on it.  I have no plans to pay this off early.  Lastly, I've got 3 months of severence and healthcare coverage following my termination and vested some RSUs (leadership awards, lol) at a prorated amount now in my personal trading account.  I plan to sell these while they are at a neutral cost basis, this week.

Account breakdown:

* $60k cash

* $370k taxable

* $170k roth ira

* $50k gambling with individual stocks and a bit of options (up 180% YTD, thanks RDDT!)

* $1.2m 401k/HSA

* $85k 529s

* $80k in vehicles (2020, 2021)

* $1.1m residence, $650k equity

We used to track expenses religiously but totally fell off the wagon in 2023 and 2024.  I'm currently going through 2024 expenses, month by month, but our average monthly expenses the last few years have been around $11-12k/mo.  We live in a MCOL area in the Midwest with home taxes capped at 1% of our appraised value.  Not having fully gone through all 2024 expenses for the year yet, from what I can see we can very easily cut expenses down to about $8-9k/mo without any major hit to lifestyle.  Apparently I bought a lot of coffee and ate out way too much this year, and my wife has a HomeGoods addiction.  MMM would be disappointed in us, I'm sure.

Since getting laid off, I've had a few calls with recruiters that are jobs I'm not sure I'd actually want - e.g. one was a 100% road warrior job that pays extremely well with an equity stake but I'd have to travel constantly.  This has caused me to pause and reconsider what it is I want, which I frankly don't know.  This past year has been great because I've worked low hours, and been home most of the time which has allowed me to spend more time with the family, and contribute around the house in a way I haven't in years.  So far this week, I've been enjoying crushing my to-do list every day and spending a ton of time with the family.  I'm pretty handy so I have a looooong list of house projects I can work on for probably multiple years.  I've also taken over cooking and I am enjoying meal prep/planning as a temporary job.  If I'm honest, I'm enjoying myself at this exact moment.

However, my wife is panicking which is kind of her MO, but it's the only thing that I find stressful while not working.  I'm of the opinion that there is no rush to find immediate employment meanwhile she's looking for jobs for me more than I am.  That one is probably above the paygrade of r/fi but I wanted to include it for full disclosure of stuff going through my mind right now.  Personally, I feel like the math puts us firmly in coastFIRE territory with just a little bit of expense control, though I'm not sure how healthcare would work?

Questions to those of you not in my emotional shoes:

* How would you approach figuring out next steps?  I feel like we don't need to rush, though my wife would vehemently disagree

* Healthcare: A quick look at a healthcare calculator with $80k/yr income from my wife looks like we could pay just $183/mo for a family of 5 with ""financial help"".  Without financial help, it would cost $1485/mo.  Does that seem correct??

* Is dental included in ACA stuff?

* Outside of brushing up on my resume & filing for unemployment, is there anything else major I should be doing right this moment?

* What else??",71,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1go47jj/laid_off_this_past_week_maybe_coastfire_maybe_not/
financialindependence,Why is group self-annuitization not more popular amongst the FIRE community? Potential to boost SWR from 4% to 6%,"First, let me explain for those who don’t know what I’m talking about.

Group self-annuitization (also known as modern tontine, VPLA, pooled annuities) refers to the practice of individuals pooling their money together to reduce longevity risk .  Longevity risk is the risk of outliving your investments.

For example, 100 FIRE enthusiasts who have retired could agree to pool their investments together and provide income for life for each other.  When a member dies some (or all) of their investment remains in the pool to support income for the members still alive; thus reducing everyone’s risk of outliving their money.  

Based on my research, this could improve safe withdrawal rates (SWR) from 4% to 6% for a group of 65 year olds.  

I recognize that this structure faces certain legal and complexity issues but shouldn’t someone in the FIRE community be able to figure this out? It seems this type of structure could potentially benefit us the most.",0,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gp1dd6/why_is_group_selfannuitization_not_more_popular/

I'm putting it in my HYSA as I'm thinking about buying another property, though the HYSA is also my emergency savings. Main outgoing expenses are travel related. I own my house outright, but it's old and has some damage that I'm slowly working on repairing. I moved from a VHCOL area back to my MCOL hometown to take care of my mom. I'm a first generation immigrant from an educated, but not very financially literate parent. She owns her own home (150K) which she's renting out for $1400, retired and receives a pension from my dad and her SSI, but only has about 66K in a Roth IRA which she hasn't touched yet and 20K in a HYSA I set up for her. She's relatively healthy, but I'm noticing some signs of both physical and mental deterioration. The next financial move I was thinking about was putting her home in a trust.

Edited to correct and add that monthly net pay is 7K, not 8K, and quick back of hand calculation on budget is that required monthly expenses are around $2,100. These are necessary expenses like utilities, car insurance, and groceries. I pay utilities for both my house and my mother's house so that's why that's kind of high.

financialindependence,When can I reasonably stop contributing to my 401k?,"There was a conversation in the comments section of a post that blew my mind from about a week ago, in which it was stated that there comes a time in which it no longer makes much sense to continue contributing to 401k.  Essentially, it was stated that once the account has reached a certain amount, the natural/organic growth of the account from compound interest, dividends, and market performance significantly outweighs the impact that your individual contributions can make.  I had never considered this possibility before and had always figured I had to continue contributing right up until the day I'm ready to retire.

Well, now I'm wondering if I've already reached that stage.  I'm 44 years old and want to retire at 59 1/2.  My wife and I have approximately $1.3M in 401k accounts.  If I'm contributing the annual maximum each year then that contribution only makes up approximately 1% of the growth of the account for that year.  Whereas compound interest, dividends, and market performance make up for the remaining 99% of the growth for that year.

If I stop contributing now, then I've got 15 years for the account to grow on its own, without me contributing anything to it.  I don't know how to do the math to estimate how much it could/should be worth in 15 years using conservative estimates.  I'm hoping someone here might know how to do that.  If I want to be able to spend at least $100,000 per year (in today's dollars) at that time, will my 401k have enough to be able to do so?

  
EDIT: I really need to stop making posts right before I go to bed.  But based the responses so far, I think I need to add some additional clarifications.  

* I should mention that my wife does not have her own 401K.  She's been a SAHM for most of our marriage.  So we really are only contributing at most $23K per year; not $46K.
* We do have other sources of income as well.  We own a duplex outright that's worth about $500K and cash flowing about $3K per month in rental income.
* We have not yet paid off our primary residence.  We owe about $270,000 on the mortgage with a 3.125% interest rate. It's worth about $800,000.  So we have about $500K in equity in our primary residence.
* We have about $100K in cryptocurrency (ETH/BTC).
* We have 3 daughters.  Each of them have their own 529 college fund with only about $20K.  One of them is already in college and burning those funds fairly quickly.  The other two are in their teens.
* Net worth including everything is about: $2.58M.

  
Some have asked, what would we do with the money that we would no longer be contributing to the 401K.  This is where I may be a little greedy.  

Ideas are:

* Put more into my children's college funds.  
* Get a loan (\~$100K) to remodel the primary residence and use these funds to pay for it.
* Put more into our vacation fund.  Currently saving about $400 per month.
* Put more into the vehicle fund and get a nicer car.  Currently saving about $800 per month.
* Purchase a vacation property and use those funds to pay the mortgage on that property.",103,98,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gnrulf/when_can_i_reasonably_stop_contributing_to_my_401k/

I was raised in a lower middle class family where credit cards were the norm. Saving for retirement was an afterthought. When my parent's divorced, I watched my parents struggle financially. It's hard to watch them still make such poor choices with spending. I was lucky to graduate college without any loans between merit based aid and part time work. I still racked up credit card debt in college and it was 2017 before I really started making better choices financially. Began 2017 with about 5k in credit card debt, 12k in a car loan, making 37k a year. Rounding out 2024 with no debt, making 78k a year.

No debt.

I turned 30 in May this year. I could have more saved for sure but I prioritize a few trips a year (most notably, took my grandfather to Yellowstone last Fall and really glad to have that memory...this year he was diagnosed with dementia that is progressing fast. Very glad that I didn't put this trip off.)

Anyways, I guess I am just proud of myself. But I don't want to brag to people who know me. So I'm bragging to strangers..some who certainly wouldn't find this bragworthy :) I worked hard, budgeted hard, and certainly lucked out in some ways (low rent payment, no student loans).

# Trump's Nightmare: The Critical Resource Biden Couldn't Secure



As U.S. President Biden nears the end of his term, there’s one little-known metal whose scarcity is keeping him up at night even today. And analysts warn that President-elect Donald Trump is likely to inherit this headache too.

The metal is not gold, silver, or uranium. It’s not the lithium used for EV batteries. It’s not the copper that is essential for electrification. It’s not even the rare earth elements that are crucial for everything from smartphones to wind turbines.

This metal has a global annual production of less than 100,000 tons – a small fraction of the lead, copper, and iron produced every year. But it is a vital component in everything from armor-piercing bullets, nuclear weapons, explosive missiles to fire retardants in electronics and military uniforms. Most importantly, there are no viable alternatives at the moment.

But one forward-looking company, **Military Metals Corp.** **(**[**CSE:MILI**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MILI.CN/)**;**[ **OTCQB:MILIF**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MILIF/)**),** has recently purchased historically-proven deposits that could swiftly address America's most pressing resource vulnerability in recent times.

**The metal we’re talking about is antimony,** and its scarcity has Western governments rattled.

Military Metals CEO Scott Eldridge[ sees](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/MILIF/military-metals-announces-management-6r3hgdzrai1j.html#:~:text=Military%2520Metals%2520Corp.,to%2520serve%2520on%2520the%2520board.) a major antimony supply crunch coming. And antimony prices this year, along with new Chinese restrictions add extra support to that prediction with prices tripling since earlier this year from[ $12,000 per ton to $38,000](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timtreadgold/2024/09/09/double-your-money-buying-what-china-refuses-to-sell/). That’s why the company acquired past-producing antimony mines on two continents at breakneck speed.

But first, let’s zoom in on antimony demand, and prices, and why they are going through the roof right now.

**The Global Antimony Supply Squeeze**

The current crisis stems from China’s dominance in both global antimony production and refining. China, Russia, and Tajikistan control 85% of the world’s antimony supply.

Antimony is not easy to extract and it’s often a by-product in the extraction of other metals like gold, silver, or copper. And China, which also currently controls 65% of global antimony refining capacity, has just imposed troubling new restrictions on its export.

Because China controls most of the world’s antimony, when they cut supply Western military supply chains are directly impacted.

According to a recent[ article](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-antimony-export-restrictions-impact-us-national-security) published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C., the U.S. only has 20 days’ worth of antimony inventory. Germany has just[ 2 days](https://www.ft.com/content/8616b418-6c2c-45e9-aaa3-2b89bb67f9fc)’ worth of munitions supply. And geopolitical tensions in Ukraine, the Middle East, Afghanistan, and other places continue to aggravate the demand for antimony.

So, antimony demand from defense is at record highs right now, and it’s only going to increase exponentially in the years to come.

**(**[**CSE:MILI**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MILI.CN/)**;**[ **OTCQB:MILIF**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MILIF/)**),**

**Washington's $1.8 Billion Antimony Push**

All these factors have together pushed antimony prices past $38,000 per ton – a 300% price increase in just the last 24 months. And this might just be the start!

Understandably, political support for securing critical mineral supply chains across the globe is intensifying.

Major economies like the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Japan, Australia, the European Union, and South Korea have all classified antimony as a “critical mineral.” And the U.S. government is keen on backing domestic antimony projects to reduce dependence on Chinese imports.

As a part of that initiative, Perpetua Resources Corp., a mining company focused on developing gold-antimony deposits in the Stibnite district of Idaho, is securing a $1.8B loan from U.S. Export-Import Bank, along with an additional $60M from the Department of Defense.

As a result, Perpetua’s[ stock](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PPTA/) has shot up over 400% since March this year.

But this rapid surge is just one example of the antimony sector's explosive potential.

Now, **Military Metals Corp** **(**[**CSE:MILI**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MILI.CN/)**;**[ **OTCQB:MILIF**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MILIF/)**),** an under-the-radar company with premium assets in friendly NATO territory is positioning itself for even bigger success...

The company[ recently announced](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/military-metals-enters-definitive-agreement-123000486.html) that it has purchased one of Europe’s largest antimony deposits in Slovakia. The flagship Trojarova property here features a historical Soviet-era resource of 61,998.4 tonnes of antimony which has a in-situ value of over $2 billion of antimony in the ground at today’s spot prices. Located just 30 minutes from Bratislava with excellent infrastructure, the company thinks they can fast-track this project with a resource estimate within 6 months.

Then there’s the Tienesgrund property, also in Slovakia, which covers 13.38 km² and encompasses 40-50 historical mining tunnels dating back to 1840. Historical Soviet-era work estimated 162t with an average grade of 7.7% antimony here, and the company expects to establish a resource within 12 months.

Their West Gore property in Nova Scotia, which was one of Canada's largest antimony producers during World War I still holds significant unmined material. Historical ore extracts showed as high as 46% antimony content.

Lastly, their Bear Creek property in Slovakia is a historical high-grade tin resource. The company got this project as a part of their Slovakia deal, but they’re thinking of divesting this to get money for their antimony projects.

**Key Factors Driving Military Metals Corp.’s Story**

At this critical point in the antimony market, Military Metals Corp. stands out for five key reasons...

1. Significant Growth Potential: Even though the Military Metals Corp. stock has seen a substantial run in recent times, with the current market cap of just $23M vs real asset potential, there’s a lot more upside yet to be unlocked.
2. Rising Market Awareness: Growing media coverage in the Financial Times, Forbes, etc., gives early investors a massive advantage in capitalizing on the coming antimony surge.
3. Pure Antimony Play: Unlike gold or oil, there are no ETFs or futures contracts to trade antimony. Equity investments into junior mining companies, like Military Metals Corp., is the only real way to get exposure to antimony.
4. Premium Asset Portfolio: The company has assets located at three prime locations in Slovakia and one location in Canada. Plus, the project qualifies under the European Critical Raw Materials Act, potentially helping to accelerate its development.

To sum up, as global demand for antimony continues to rise and geopolitical tensions persist, securing stable supplies outside of China’s control remains a key challenge for Western nations.

# Summary of Analyst report for Q3

3Q24 Misses Estimates, Reflecting Lumpiness/Timing of Projects. Notable Progress Occurring Across All Segments. **Reaffirm Buy Rating And $0.38 Price Target. (112% Above todays levels)**

This report is written by Richard Ryan of Oak Ridge Financial Research on BioLargo, Inc. (BLGO). The key points are:

1. BioLargo is a cleantech and life sciences innovator that develops solutions for environmental problems like PFAS contamination, water/wastewater treatment, odor/VOC control, air quality, and infection control.
2. In Q3 2024, BLGO reported revenues of $4.4M, up 63% year-over-year, but down sequentially due to timing of projects. Its pet odor product Pooph accounted for 76% of revenues.
3. BLGO's PFAS remediation solution has a municipal project underway and a growing pipeline of opportunities. Its wound irrigation solution Bioclynse is nearing commercialization with a potential major partner.
4. BLGO is also developing a liquid sodium battery technology, still in early stages.
5. The analyst affirms a Buy rating and $0.38 price target, based on a 5.0x EV/Revenue multiple on 2025 estimates and an independent valuation of Clyra Medical.
6. In a bull case scenario, the analyst sees potential for the PFAS technology to contribute $14M in 2025 revenues, supporting a $0.50 price target.
7. Key risks include lack of profitability, cash requirements, revenue concentration, regulatory approvals, competition, and future dilution.
8. The analyst believes BLGO's diversified portfolio of solutions offers multiple ""shots on goal"" and underlying support from Pooph and Clyra, while the emerging opportunities present an interesting ""call option"" for investors.
9. The analyst has not included estimates for potential new Pooph products or the battery technology in the base case valuation.
10. Oak Ridge Financial maintains its investment banking relationship and compensation expectations with the subject company.

**Price Targets:** 

**Base Case: $0.38** 

**Bull Case: $0.50**

# OP

IMHO the analyst seems very conservative with his PT.

The price has been at .45 already this year. But profit taking, active bringing down of price by the swing traders and the delays of the Clyra medical launch brought the price down to valuation as low as not even the Blockbuster POOPH sucess would be happening.

The Clyra production start ""that will change verything"" is targeted for Q1 or latst Q2.

While this is very frustrating for some longs - and caused some selling of the impatient- it can also be seen as a big opportunity;

It is the perfect time to discover this and it is well worth a deep dive as the POOPH success alone does validate a much higher market cap. he retail rollaout from 35K to 80K locations is in full swing and it is the bestseller on most platforms.

Also  BioLargo estimates the future value of three of their other subsidiaries above a Billion Dollars, each.

Each of them is like a very promising Medical or Clean tech company on their own.

Many of us longs have been adding and have positions well above a million shares as it seems very likely that $BLGO will be a big multi-bagger if the company executes on its promising pipeline.

Also noteworthy is that we are a super well informed shareholder community that is discussing BLGO 24/7 on many platforms (yes, there is that much happening with the pipeline that it is fun to dive deep  into it ;)

Best of luck investing and Happy Thanksgiving!

pennystocks,Helium Evolution hit their 4th helium well! Joint North American Helium/HEVI drill program underway.,"The news came yesterday that Helium Evolution - $HEVI hit more helium! Completion testing underway.  4-7 more wells yet to be drilled in the current joint North American Helium/HEVI campaign.

HEVI.V has hit helium in 4 wells over the last 12 months with the official go ahead for a plant construction expected by the end of the year.

**Who is North American Helium**

“(North American Helium) is creating a new Helium Hub in North America with **both gas and liquid helium capability in Saskatchewan.**

In 2024, NAH will be actively engaged in exploration, delineating discovered resources, investing in Engineering and ***future plant/liquefier components*** as well as constructing new helium purification plants.”

HEVI is the indirect exposure to North American Helium. North American Helium owns just under 10% of HEVI and are the ones drilling, building the plant and producing the gas.

In return HEVI doesn’t need to raise major capital leading to mass dilution like we have seen in all the other microcap helium ventures. 

So far North American Helium has invested over $30million into HEVI helium well drills with 2 strong wells with good flow rates to show for it. Plus a third well with below average flow rates. North American then decided to proceed with a 6-9 well drill program again partnered with HEVI this winter. 

That’s another $12-$18million investment. So my common sense assumption is they must like what they see.

This is more than “the next drill results” Right now the venture market is doing horrible. Not much interest in venture companies today. Investors who actually look ahead the 3-5 years and pick their spots realize the future potential of HEVI. 

Also, **Also Brad Wall, the well respected former Premier of Saskatchewan(retired 2017), is on the HEVI board of directors.** This adds so much more credibility to me as an investor in Helium Evolution.

One of the biggest challenges to the widespread adoption of quantum computing is the problem of balancing computing tasks efficiently between classical computing systems and emergent quantum systems.  Spectral's Quantum Balance™ patent details a dynamic algorithmic approach to determining task allocation between quantum and classical systems.

""We are in the process now of designing and selling our decentralized cloud computing services and one of our key differentiators is a quantum forward approach, including enhanced cyber security.  Having a proprietary approach where we can demonstrate efficiency of the use of quantum systems immediately is a key to our success.  Over time, the Quantum Balance™ system will continue to learn the most efficient allocation of tasks between classical and quantum computing,"" said Jenifer Osterwalder, CEO of Spectral Capital.

""I've been working on the development of these systems with some of the finest software architects in the world, inside and outside of government.  The problem of how to balance the load between these two types of systems efficiently, and how to create a dynamic system that will learn over time, has been vexing.  I think we now have an approach that can grow over time with our customers in the Quantum Balance™ approach,"" said Spectral Chairman and inventor of the Quantum Balance™ approach, Sean Michael Brehm.

The patent application for the Quantum Balance technology will remain confidential until review by the patent office is completed, at which time the approach, if approved, will be published.

pennystocks,Biggest GOLD discovery in Australian history? Part 3. Crown Prince is in play now... ,"Okay, New Murchison Gold (NMG) has UPGRADED that incredible interception that is 4 meters in thickness and 52 metres deep.  
It's EVEN BIGGER than was first detected!

So instead of an incredible 1,368grams of gold from every ton of dirt they dig at that level, **the newer upgraded report now sees an incredible 1,568grams of gold per ton they dig out.** 

Now let that sink in for a moment- that's 50.4 troy ounces of gold from every ton of dirt they dig at that level.   
  
What's that you say?   
You like Antiques Roadshow when someone comes in with a gold ring they discovered after 5 years of detecting and the appraiser tells them it's worth two thousand dollars. Yeah, well, forgive me if I yawn at that but gold is $2,638 per ounce today and when New Murchison gets onto that level in the pit they're extending, they're going to be pulling out well over 50 tons of dirt per day at that level... you do the math. 

Look, you'll not see an interception of gold like this again for years. I think this is maybe the third strike of pay dirt with this extraordinary amount of gold in Australian history.   
So for goodness sake, get on this asap as the first dividend from the Crown Prince lode is due middle 2025.

\# There are around 7.4 bn shares in NMG.   
\# Shares are 0.011 cents Australian each.  
\# CEO says that 50% of everything will be returned to the shareholder in the form of dividends and the numbers he's quoting are modest- they're deliberately underestimating yields.   
  
\# You'll have to talk with your broker to organise your buy via the Australian Stock Exchange. Maybe some of your funky trading accounts have access to the Australian Stock Exchange(ASX) ?  
  
\# Over 78 million shares in New Murchison Gold changed hands today after the new upgraded gold intercept calculation was made, due to further drills.

pennystocks,$NVRO Monetizing valuable metals from mine waste and tailings while being Eco-Friendly,"A Vancouver-based technology company is enabling the global mining industry to monetize valuable metals from mine waste and tailings while reducing environmental liabilities.  
  
In this interview, EnviroGold Global (CSE: NVRO | OTCQB: ESGLF | FRA: YGK) CEO, Founder, and Executive Director David Cam discusses the company’s mission, commercialization phase, and proprietary technology. This technology transforms hazardous mine waste into dry stackable tailings while extracting precious, strategic, and base metals such as gold, silver, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, iron, and rare earth elements.

pennystocks,WEEDMAPS (MAPS),"Here’s the thesis. The people love the weed and as of late, the hype has died down anything cannabis-related, and understandably so. There haven’t been any recent major changes to the industry and as of now, it's not exactly a cash cow. According to Forbes, only 27% of related businesses claim to be profitable which appears to be the result of heavy taxation and economic strong-arming due to its classification as a Schedule 1 drug. So why am I going in? Easy. Trump is back and RFK will oversee the Health and Human Services Department. RFK ran for the presidency with the idea of decriminalizing marijuana as one of his talking points. That in and of itself wouldn’t be enough to sway me. Still, with the new cabinet and what I perceive as the general vibe towards the substance, I believe there will be major reforms regarding the substance, and Republicans as a whole do nothing but benefit from paving the way for its legality.

I feel weed stocks are the move but I’m to lazy to do the DD into what could work. Genually, the only name I can think of is TLRY and even that doesn’t get me going. But what about MAPS, Weedmaps? First and foremost, they are the only name in the game. Sure LFLY exists but comparatively it's David vs Goliath that Weedmaps is. Think of it, the current market cap for MAPS is 60x Leafly and it's actually profitable. On top of that, MAPS has relatively NO LIABILITIES and is increasing its cash position. Other than a recession or some draconian measures to degrade cannabis legality, it has only upside potential.

P.S. I hate weed and I don’t smoke it. My opinion is purely based on what I expect to happen and the primo position MAPS is in both as a utility and financially.

Position. 3,500 shares @ 1.26.

• $0.27 cent actual price per share 
• 28.9m shares outstanding 
• 14/5m float 
• investment in sky centrics USA and hetaro labs Hong Kong 
• investment Africa for devices sells


borqs tech is a hong kong company and works in IOT, AI business and with patents/licenses from qualcomm, google and samsung.

this company went down from nasdaq to otc last year due to poor management by ceo pat chan but in the last few weeks we can see the light at the end of the tunnel.
sasken, indian iot company has proposed about $40m for all the chinese and indian assets of borqs tech. this means cutting losses and costs and completely monetizing the business.

In early 2024, borqs tech also sold HHE (holo hou energy), a very famous company in Hawaii for the photovoltaic and battery business. There are no sales data to date but rumors spoke of 50/80 m $ of sales. full cash.

Borqs tech has then paid all debts, monetized both HHE and IOT assets in China and India and now should have a large liquidity in hand + investors in hetaro labs with solana (yes, the crypto) + skycentrics for green solutions to reduce CO2

it is very likely that borqs tech is investing in africa with M-kopa a giant that leases IOT devices and smartphones to africans. A $30m business to start for borqs tech.

pennystocks,Will the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Hurt or Help My Biotech Stocks?,"Biotech has been a bright spot in 2024, delivering innovation and strong performance that have fueled my enthusiasm for the sector. Looking ahead to 2025, I remain optimistic about biotech's potential to continue thriving, driven by advancements in cutting-edge therapies and a growing focus on healthcare innovation. However, optimism alone isn’t enough in the face of potential challenges. The recent nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services introduces uncertainty, with proposed policies that could disrupt vaccine initiatives, research funding, and regulatory practices. With these factors in mind, I want to highlight some of my favorite biotech stocks and then dive deeper into some potential positives and concerns going into this new administration in 2025.

**Biotech Spotlight #1: $OSTX**OS Therapies Inc. is a clinical-stage company dedicated to developing treatments for osteosarcoma and other solid tumors. Their innovative pipeline, robust funding, and partnerships make them a standout in oncology therapeutics.

Lead Candidate - OST-HER2:

* Phase 2b trial targeting HER2-positive osteosarcoma patients.
* Utilizes a Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) vector to stimulate the immune system against cancer cells.

Tunable Drug Conjugate (TDC) Platform:

* Targets folate receptor-α expressing ovarian cancer.
* Potential applications in additional solid tumors.

Strong Financial and Operational Foundation:

* Secured $46 million in funding to advance OST-HER2 and OST-TDC.
* Established partnerships for manufacturing and development.

Market Potential:

* Low float of 1.6 million shares creates scarcity value.
* Focus on unmet medical needs in pediatric and adult populations.

**Biotech Spotlight #2: $CTXR**

Citius Pharmaceuticals is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing first-in-class critical care products. Their diversified pipeline includes:

* LYMPHIR™ (denileukin diftitox-cxdl): FDA-approved for adult patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Commercialization efforts are underway to make this therapy available to patients. 
* Mino-Lok®: An antibiotic lock solution for catheter-related bloodstream infections. A Phase 3 trial demonstrated that catheter failure occurred significantly later in patients treated with Mino-Lok compared to those receiving a clinician-directed anti-infective lock solution. 
* Stem Cell Platform: Developing induced mesenchymal stem cells (i-MSCs) for treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other inflammatory conditions. 

Now, let’s start with the challenges for the biotech industry with new administration**Potential Challenges:**

* Leadership Appointments: The nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known for his vaccine skepticism, as Secretary of Health and Human Services has raised concerns about potential shifts in public health policies. Such changes could impact vaccine development and approval processes, introducing uncertainty for biotech companies involved in vaccine research.
   * Vaccine Policy Overhaul: Kennedy plans to reassess vaccine safety, reduce access, and alter federal guidelines.
   * Agency Reforms: Proposes restructuring the CDC and FDA, cutting departments, and limiting pharmaceutical advertising.
   * Alternative Medicine Focus: Redirecting NIH funds toward holistic and alternative treatments.

**Potential Benefits:**

* Regulatory Environment: Trump's administration is expected to continue prioritizing deregulation, which could expedite drug approvals and foster innovation within the biotech sector. This approach may particularly benefit companies developing breakthrough therapies, such as those in oncology and gene therapy.
* Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A): Analysts anticipate that a Trump-led Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will adopt a more accommodating stance toward M&A activities. This could facilitate consolidation and strategic partnerships within the biotech industry, potentially leading to increased investment and growth opportunities.

For those who missed it, back in 2019, Ryder revealed that they had overstated the expected residual value of their trucking fleet. They had to reduce their earnings forecasts due to declining truck values, and later disclosures confirmed increased depreciation expenses. This caused a big drop in $R, and investors filed a lawsuit accusing Ryder of financial misrepresentation.

To put the case to rest, Ryder has agreed to pay investors a $45M settlement. So, if you missed the deadline, you can still file for it since late claims are being considered by the court.

pennystocks,Atos ($ATO): Major Turnaround Potential with Recent Catalysts 🚀,"Hey fellow penny stock enthusiasts!

I want to share some insights on **Atos SE ($ATO)**, which has been on my radar lately. This French IT services company has faced challenges, but recent developments suggest a potential turnaround story in the making. Here's why I think Atos could see significant upward momentum in the coming months and years:

# The Backstory

* Atos was once a high-performing stock, reaching highs of **€64.30 in 2019**, but it has since declined by **98%** due to mounting debt, poor management decisions, and market challenges.
* Despite its struggles, Atos has recently shown signs of life, with its stock price rebounding by nearly **40% in the last month**, currently trading around **€1.00**.

# Why I'm Bullish on Atos

1. **Government Backing**:
   * The French government recently expressed interest in acquiring Atos' **advanced computing division**, a move that could stabilise the company financially and restore investor confidence.
   * This signals that Atos' technology is considered **strategically important**, which reduces the risk of further downside.
2. **Big Partnerships and Contracts**:
   * Named the **Official Technology Partner for the Invictus Games 2025**, showcasing its ability to secure high-profile projects.
   * Extended a **€165 million contract with EUROCONTROL**, ensuring a steady revenue stream.
   * Delivering Finland's **national AI supercomputer**, a significant win for its Eviden brand.
3. **Innovation Leadership**:
   * Atos' **Eviden supercomputers** ranked #1 and #2 for energy efficiency on the **Green500 list**, proving its technological edge in sustainable computing.
   * Advancements in **quantum emulation and AI** solidify Atos' position in cutting-edge tech markets.
4. **Potential Catalyst**:
   * Trading was temporarily halted by **Euronext Paris**, hinting at potential major announcements on the horizon. Could this be a restructuring deal or another government-backed initiative?

# Price Targets

Based on the current momentum and potential catalysts, here are my **short- and mid-term price targets**:

* **Short Term (3-6 months):** €1.20–€1.50
   * Driven by ongoing optimism, restructuring progress, and contract execution.
* **Mid Term (1-2 years):** €2.00–€5.00
   * If Atos successfully implements its turnaround strategy, reduces debt, and leverages its strategic partnerships and tech leadership.

# Risks to Consider

* **Debt Levels**: Atos is still carrying significant debt (\~€5 billion), and restructuring efforts may take time to reflect in its financials.
* **Dilution**: Potential equity raises to manage debt could dilute shares.
* **Execution Risk**: The turnaround depends on Atos' ability to deliver on its contracts and restructuring plans.

# Final Thoughts

Atos is a classic high-risk, high-reward play. While the challenges are real, the combination of government backing, strategic contracts, and innovative technology could make this a compelling opportunity for patient investors. If you're looking for a speculative penny stock with significant upside potential, **$ATO** might be worth adding to your watchlist.

What do you think? Are you bullish or bearish on Atos? Let’s discuss!

*(Not financial advice, DYOR!)*

# WARNING! 

As of November 27, 2024, Atos SE (stock symbol: ATO) is undergoing a significant financial restructuring plan aimed at addressing its substantial debt and stabilizing its financial position. This plan involves converting approximately €2.9 billion of debt into equity and includes an equity injection of €233 million. These measures are expected to result in substantial dilution for existing shareholders, potentially reducing their holdings to less than 0.1% of the company's share capital post-restructuring.

The restructuring process is anticipated to be completed between the end of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025. While specific dates for the dilution effects have not been disclosed, shareholders should be aware that these changes are imminent and will significantly impact their ownership stakes.

Given the substantial dilution expected, it is crucial for current and prospective investors to stay informed about Atos' restructuring developments and consider the potential implications for their investments.",4,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1h1799s/atos_ato_major_turnaround_potential_with_recent/

pennystocks,ES Gold Potential,"One of the reasons I’m looking into ESGold with such interest is their location: Quebec. If you’re not familiar with it, Quebec is one of the world’s most attractive jurisdictions for mining. This isn’t just my opinion; it’s backed by data. According to the Fraser Institute, Quebec excels in mineral potential and provides a regulatory environment that’s both stable and transparent. For a mining company, this is pure gold—pun intended. The province has streamlined permitting processes, generous tax incentives, and a highly skilled workforce. It’s a place where mining companies don’t have to worry about regulatory surprises or unstable policies.

ESGold’s Montauban project benefits directly from this supportive environment. With a government that’s pro-mining and infrastructure that’s already world-class, ESGold can focus on what matters: efficient production and responsible expansion. And Quebec’s VMS (Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide) deposits have been famously rich. Just look at success stories like the Horne and Matagami camps, where high-grade deposits have produced millions of tonnes of ore. With ESGold’s own substantial land package, largely unexplored, they have a real opportunity to become one of Quebec’s next big mining successes.

The Montauban project’s location isn’t just a backdrop; it’s a huge asset in itself. Quebec’s history of mining, its favorable policies, and the presence of major players like Osisko and Glencore all point to the fact that this is where great projects happen. If ESGold taps even a fraction of that potential, we’re looking at a highly promising opportunity in a prime location.

Net loss is down to $700k for Q3. There is **ZERO debt and they have $3M in cash which cant last them the next year or more** depending on how they continue to improve operation costs.

**This company was trading around a $500M valuation in 2021** and is now sitting near the **52-week low** at a **TINY $3M MC.**. They have that in cash alone. $9M in assets with only $700K in total liabilities.

Cycerlion Therapeutics is led by very high-power executives with MASSIVE Connections.

The Chair of the Board of Directors for CYCN **Errol De Souza, PhD,** founded **$NBIX (Currently a $13 Billion Dollar Company)** trading at **$130 per share** and has had explosive growth. **$NBIX Neurocrine Biosciences Inc** was trading at **$2 PER SHARE** in 2009!

**Peter Hecht**, The EX-CEO and current strategic advisor of **CYCN** co-founded **$IRWD ($550M Company)** which traded around **a $3 Billion Dollar Valuation** earlier in the year. He was CEO of **$IRWD** from 1998-2018.

**The Newly appointed CEO was the VP of $EQRx which got bought out for around $1 BILLION Dollars.**

**CYCN** is currently seeking an in-license agreement which is a **Huge Catalyst**. **$MNPR** ran from **$4 to $40 off an in-license PR recently.** 

Cyclerion is also seeking mergers / acquisitions and other big catalysts which is stated on their website.

Exact words from the last issued Press Release:

 She has been working closely with the Board of Directors to prioritize building shareholder value by reducing Cyclerion’s operating costs while **leading a world-class search and evaluation team,** currently triaging multiple business development prospects for which Cyclerion believes it is well suited.

The drilling spanned over 1,500 meters across four different drill holes, targeting nickel-copper-cobalt mineralization in the Eureka Zone. This area is already known for its extensive nickel resources, with 3.9 billion pounds in the indicated category and over 4.2 billion pounds in the inferred category, making it one of the larger nickel deposits in the United States. 

The completion of this program is expected to provide further geological and mineralogical data, which will be key for refining the company's understanding of the mineral resource. This information could also be used to identify additional areas for future drilling and exploration. Nickel, as a critical component in electric vehicle (EV) batteries, is experiencing increased demand, and domestic projects like Nikolai are crucial in securing a stable supply. 

Alaska Energy Metals is currently analyzing the drill results, and the findings will be published soon. The data will not only help define the scale of the mineralization but also guide future strategic decisions related to project development. What are everyone's thoughts on the company? I have been watching closely.

pennystocks,"$KDLY May I Kindly MD ask for your attention. Penny play of the day imo.
","**Momentum building**  
With a tight float of 1.90 million shares and a short interest of 18%, Kindly MD is a candidate for a big move up. Given the tight float, even modest buying pressure could lead to significant price movements.

**Share Buyback Program**  
Kindly MD has initiated a $500,000 share repurchase program. Strong indicator of management's confidence in the company's future. The company aims to reduce the number of outstanding shares, which can enhance earnings per share (EPS) and potentially drive up the stock price.

**Insider Holdings**  
A significant 68% of Kindly MD's shares are held by insiders. Those closest to the company believe in its long-term success, aligning their interests with any HODLER out there.

**Operational Highlights:**  
\- Achieved above 90% statewide insurance coverage in Utah with the addition of the largest health insurer in the United States, United Healthcare Insurance.

\- Introduced $500,000 share repurchase program to enhance shareholder value.

 \-Recognized as one of the winners of the Healthcare AI Impact Award 2024.

\- The cash on hand for KDLYis $4.74M as of 6/30/2024.

**Market Potential**  
The healthcare data market is projected to reach $280 billion by 2027. This growth presents a substantial opportunity for Kindly MD to expand its footprint and enhance its service offerings.

**Political Context**  
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. now in theTrump administration, is a proponent of psychedelic and cannabis treatments. His influence could positively impact the regulatory landscape for companies like these, cannabis and psychedelics.

**Conclusion**  
In summary, Kindly MD's share buyback program, high insider ownership, increasing revenue, political climate and the potential for a big move up makes it a buy and HODL for me.

pennystocks,FRGE Buy & Hold Option,"TLDR: The stock may currently be undervalued due to short-term concerns about profitability. Continued focus on revenue growth and cost management will be crucial for Forge's path to profitability, and it seems management is focused on this. This is not shminvestment shmadvice.

Forge Global Holdings has experienced consistent net losses over recent years, with slight improvements in revenue and EPS. The company's efforts to reduce operating expenses have not yet led to profitability. The decline total assets and equity, coupled with increased cash usage in operations, indicates financial challenges. Analysts have adjusted future revenue and earnings expectations downward.

All of this sounds horrible, right? Wrong! 

Forge is well-positioned to capitalize on increasing demand for liquidity among pre-IPO companies and their shareholders. The global private securities market is growing, with more companies staying private for longer. This has created a demand for secondary liquidity. Specifically, venture capital investments hit record highs in recent years. Forge benefits from this trend.

Also, let's expand on these financial difficulties to see if the market is dramaticizing them. Their net loss decreased from $111.9 million in 2021 to $76.5 million in 2023, demonstrating progress toward profitability. 

Meanwhile, revenue has remained stable despite market volatility, which indicates earnings resilience. Market downturns have limited the volume of secondary transactions in recent years, but as the economy recovers and IPO activity resumes, Forge is poised to benefit from increased trading volumes. Its revenue model, driven by transaction fees, will thrive in an environment of heightened activity. Forge also has a strong equity position of $268.4 million as of 2023 and low liabilities of $42.3 million. This balance sheet strength provides a financial cushion to weather further volatility.

Finally, operating losses have declined year-over-year, showing management's focus on cost control, which, when combined with stable revenue, is a recipe for finding efficiencies and reducing overhead.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1h0mnv4/frge_buy_hold_option/

pennystocks,An Undervalued Biotech Showing Promise,"Once you review this piece, consider buying or watch listing this unique biopharmaceutical company. The company’s focus is therapy and, eventually, possibly, a cure for Pancreatic Cancer, arguably the deadliest form.

**RenovoRx (Nasdaq: RNXT)** is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel precision oncology therapies based on a local drug-delivery platform. Oncology is an international peer-reviewed journal for practicing oncologists and hematologists.

Over and above a great chart, there are salient points to consider.

* Currently, at USD1.25\*\*\*, several analysts have projected the share to move to USD8.00 on the high end and USD4.00 at the low.\*\*\*
* Recent robust trading volumes  
Presentations at many high-level Biotech conferences; 
* Ongoing Phase III TIGeR-PaC cRNXT’Sl trial RNXT’S ON TAMP therapy platform (Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion) therapy platform for treating Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC.)
* Presentation at Symposium on Clinical Interventional Oncology Highlighting TAMP™ for Targeted Treatment ofRenovoRx on RenovoRx’s pivotal ongoing Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial evaluating the proprietary TAMP™ (Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion) therapy platform for the treatment of Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC.)
* Attainment of Orphan Drug status—this is key.

Status is given to certain drugs called orphan drugs, therapies which show promise in the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of orphan diseases. An orphan disease is a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Orphan diseases are often severe or life-threatening. Also, Orphan Drug status is given to those few companies that develop products that address the public good and not simply for profit.

Behind all this, biotech is an excellent therapy with the potential to lower deadly numbers of Pancreatic Cancer. Targeting Pancreatic Cancer, which has a 5-year survival rate that is 3% (and that’s stage 1-4). That is 18 percent of patients a year. Moreover, 13% will not survive past five tears. As we all know, Pancreatic cancer is a nasty disease. RNXT’s work has the benefit of addressing this most heinous form of cancer.

pennystocks,$OPTT - One of $RCAT's partners,"I know it's been mentioned here before, and results are not guaranteed (See below), but $OPTT, or Ocean Power Technologies has a lot of potential. I know there's been a bit more interest as they're one of the partners of Red Cat. The C.E.O announced early earnings for the 2nd of December, and has suggested this has been due to much better growth than before. Some points to factor in:

  
\- They're coming out of the research and development phase and focusing now on securing contracts. They've started to secure quite a few contracts, a lot of which will show in next month's earnings. They were showing off their equipment at ADIPEC, a large energy event this month. They've also been at the Microcap conference last month. There should hopefully be a translation into future contracts as a result.

  
\- The C.E.O, Philipp Stratmann gave a presentation at the Microcap Conference in October. He said one of the reasons the share price has done badly this year is that they were subject to a hostile takeover attempt where the company (Paragon if I remember right) were spreading negative news about Optt, which then meant the shares got shorted. The takeover attempt was dropped however, but the shares never really bounced back up. With more contracts potentially on their way, this might change.

  
\- With that said, there's also been a lot of share dilution that's happened this year. At the August shareholder meeting, it was agreed that the shares should increase from 100 million to 200 million. They've gone up by an extra 20 million so far, but there's obviously around 80 million to go, and we don't know when they'll be released. So there is a danger progress will be slowed or even potentially reversed. It's not all roses with this company.

  
The share price has gone up by 15% today and I reckon over the next week it'll be wild. My gut feeling is a lot of new investors will start to put money in, while short sellers will do what they can to bring the price down.

  
If you do invest, good luck!

I would think with the new patent comes credibility. The blockchain sector is increasingly competitive, and securing a patent solidifies HUMBL's position as an innovator. Wouldn't the patent legally protect proprietary technology, allowing HUMBL to differentiate its offerings? As blockchain gains further adoption across industries (e.g., finance, supply chain, and gaming), HUMBL's unique intellectual property could attract strategic partnerships or acquisitions.

Does anyone else feel the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenized assets, blockchain ETFs, and cross-border payments could create value and interest with HUMBL's patented technology, enabling blockchain currency transfers?

With a patent comes opportunities. HUMBL can license its patented technology to other blockchain providers, generating recurring revenue streams. Collaborations with financial institutions or cryptocurrency platforms could further embed HUMBL’s technology into mainstream applications.

Patent grants often signal innovation and forward-thinking strategy, potentially attracting institutional and retail investors. As news of the patent spreads and analysts assess its implications, I would like to think the shareholders of $HMBL could experience an uptick in trading volume and valuation.

I apologise in advance for my possible mistakes in English, truth is I am from Spain, and if you have ever visited the country, it's a black hole for foreign languages :S :D

I decided that today was the day that I would share with you, to serve you just with the same willingness and good faith that you have assisted me. I am quite new to penny stocks, but my consistent wins (thanks to you! I wish I could have some referral or affiliate links to pay you back somehow... if you do have them, please share them here!) give me the courage to share my current watchlist with you. I am also adding a final question, thank you in advance for taking the time to read and reply <3 

So my current positions are shared among: KURL, MIST and LODE. 

My watchlist, based on the current status of AI, energy demand (winter time in northern hemisphere), pharma (again, winter time in northern hemisphere hehe), and a fintech just for fun: 

\- Companies dedicated to Artificial Intelligence: HPAI, SES, PDYN, GFAI, MDAI, MSAI, with forecasted increases in value between 192% and 381%

\- Energy related: BLDP, CLIR, GEO, FTEK, with expected raises between 245% and 400%. 

\- Pharma: AUTL, CKPT, ITRM, SGMO, more modest forecasts, between 219% and 321%

\- FinTech: LX, expected to improve in a 329%

  
I would love to include a food related or retail company to my watchlist, because Christmas is around the corner, but I could only find one in the Spanish market: DIDA, it's a very famous supermarket, with forecasts hoping the value of the stocks will raise around 85%. But it looks too risky, even UNI. Looks like the gambling in the food case is not even worth it. 

Do you have any food or retail companies that you like? TIA!

","Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - November 25, 2024) - **Military Metals Corp. (CSE:MILI) (OTCQB: MILIF) (FSE: QN90) (the ""Company"" or ""MILI"")** has issued an invitation to tender bids for carrying out a mineral resource estimation at the Company's Trojarová antimony-gold property in Slovakia. Three companies with recognized technical credentials were selected to submit bids.

Trojarová, located in the heart of Europe, had prior development and production operations in respect of antimony. Historical resource estimates were produced in connection with Soviet era work conducted on the property, in accordance with the Russian classification system at the time. Please refer to the Company's news release dated October 30, 2024 for more detailed information about this antimony-gold deposit and the prior estimates. The historical work conducted is instructive as to future work programs to be conducted by the Company.

The Company expects to receive bids by December 20, 2024 and to make a decision by year's end as to which company it will commission with a three-fold task:

1. Input all historical data into a digital data base, including drill logs and analyses, plans, section, underground geological mapping and sampling, historical block modeling and all other relevant data, in order to generate an independent three-dimensional model and seek to verify the accuracy of the historical estimates on the property:
2. Make recommendations to management in regard to the number, location, orientation and depth of twin and infill holes to be drilled, along with all quality assurance, quality control protocols, in order that the non-compliant historical resource can be upgraded and classified as a mineral resource in accordance with current industry standards;
3. On completion of the new drill program outlined in items 1 and 2 above, input all newly generated drill data and prepare a ""maiden"" mineral resource estimate.

Management eagerly awaits receipt of bids and then plans to move forward with the above three step program. With continuation of high antimony prices and demand, management believes that conducting work on Trojarová can add significant value for shareholders.

The technical contents of this release were reviewed and approved by Avrom E. Howard, MSc, PGeo, geological consultant to Military Metals and a qualified person as defined by NI 43-101.

The Company is a British Columbia-based mineral exploration company that is primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties with a focus on antimony.

pennystocks,"Raymond James says MURA could be acquired for $48 (it's at less than $4 now)
","[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raymond-james-predicts-440-rally-111049386.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raymond-james-predicts-440-rally-111049386.html)

With several potential catalysts on the horizon and a share price of only $3.35, Raymond James analyst Laura Prendergast sees a compelling opportunity for investors.

“We believe MURA is currently undervalued for the following reasons: 1) lead asset, nemvaluekin, has near-term commercial opportunity that doesn’t seem to be on the radar yet for many investors, 2) management and board have notable experience that inspire confidence in ability to maneuver late stage drug development/commercial launch/BD execution; 3) MURA is currently trading at a 65% discount to cash and at 98% discount to its small cap biotech peer group,” Prendergast explained.

“If MURA can execute on \[its\] catalysts, we anticipate the company could become a major buyout target. We analyzed recent biotech acquisitions with similar 5-year forward sales estimates to MURA. Average historical take out multiple for this peer group is 5x EV/5-year forward sales which implies a potential deal value of \~$1.2B and $48 target price for MURA,” the analyst further noted.

For now, Prendergast rates MURA shares a Strong Buy, while her $18 price target suggests a robust upside of \~440% on the one-year horizon.

Other analysts are also optimistic about the cancer drug maker. MURA’s Strong Buy consensus rating breaks down into 3 Buys and no Holds or Sells. In addition, the $16.33 average price target puts the upside potential at 387%.

pennystocks,PRCH is a pretty good stock and here’s why,"
Okay this is my first DD post but I honestly can't find a more undervalued stock than Porch Group, full disclosure I have 2500 shares at approximately 1.50, so I'm doing pretty good already but anyways onto the details,

Porch group is a newer home insurance group that owns a pretty good amount of other companies you may know. Here is the full list of companies that it owns, [https://porchgroup.com/companies](https://porchgroup.com/companies), now why is this relevant, well these companies generate a lot of data. This data is information on nearly 90% of US Homes.  Why is this important? Well with this data, they're able to write insurance policies better than bigger and older insurance companies. Another thing Porch group signed their first data agreement with bamboo, so we could see an increase in revenue and income if they continue with these deals and it shows that their data is valuable.

Now lets look into their financials. This recent quarter they blew the earnings out of the water, achieving profitability of 14 million dollars with 110 million in Revenue and they're projecting for the next quarter to do even better. This is insane for a 400 million dollar market cap company. Although they have lots of debt if they continue to be profitable this is a non-issue.

Now why do I think it can go up more? Lets look at their relative competitor LMND, LMND is also a relatively newer insurance company, now lets look at their market cap. 3.52 billion dollars with revenue in line with porch, but they're not even profitable!! Porch group also got approved for their reciprocal which lowers their risk exposure in areas with catastrophic weather events, and look how much it popped up when it got approved. Not only was porch at 4.75 last year before the weather events, now the company has come back stronger in almost every single way.

with all these things in mind I expect to see Porch break 5$ in the next coming months before earnings and may go even higher after another stellar earnings. Also since I'm getting tired writing this, the company is still founder owned and has excellent institutional ownership.

NFA so if it craters its not on me, do your own DD

pennystocks,Financial Outlook for my Biotech Pick,"It appears the report on $RNXT’s Q3 financial results was dropped into the media. I’ve been following this ticker closely, both fundamentals and technicals, so I’m happy to get into this report.

Looking at the financials, as of 9/30/24, RenovoRx held $9.6 million in cash, which should be sufficient through the next analysis of their Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial and support commercialization efforts for their RenovoCath devices. $RNXT reported a net loss of $2.5 million compared to their $1.4 million loss in the same quarter a year ago. The company attributes this to the decrease in the fair value of common warrants issued under the April 2023 Registered Direct Offering and increased interest and dividend income payments.

The report mentioned a few noteworthy operational highlights, such as a near full enrollment in their Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial, advancements in commercialization plans for RenovoCath, and as previously mentioned, their publication in *The Oncologist*.

I’ll drop [the rest of the article here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/renovorx-reports-third-quarter-2024-130000711.html) here so you can get the rest of the stats. $RNXT has 24,001,339 shares outstanding as of 11/7 - a fairly low float to say the least.

pennystocks,Gold Reaches an All-Time High,"Have you been keeping an eye on gold prices lately? If not, you might be surprised to learn that gold has hit new record highs, fueled by several key factors that have investors rushing to this timeless safe haven. Growing uncertainties surrounding the Middle East conflict, concerns over the upcoming US election, and a wave of central banks easing their monetary policies are all playing a part in this surge.  
As the world watches these events unfold, the demand for gold is rising. Historically, gold has been a reliable store of value when everything else seems volatile. As central banks—especially the US Federal Reserve—cut interest rates to stimulate their economies, gold tends to perform well. This is because low interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold, which doesn’t pay dividends or interest, making it more appealing.  
Let’s talk numbers. Spot gold prices rose 0.32%, reaching $2,730 per ounce, while gold futures on the Comex climbed by 0.59% to $2,746 per ounce—new record highs for the fourth straight day! These figures point to a strong, sustained rise in gold’s value, and many analysts believe it’s not over yet.  
Here’s an interesting thought: why does gold react so strongly to central banks’ decisions? Recently, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) cut its benchmark mortgage rates more than expected, causing commodity prices—including gold—to jump. And it’s not just China. Central banks worldwide, like the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Fed, are lowering rates to try and stimulate their economies.  
Another driving factor behind gold’s meteoric rise is escalating geopolitical tensions. For example, in the Middle East, increasing conflict—like the recent Hezbollah drone explosion in Israel—is pushing investors toward gold as a hedge against instability. Even the upcoming US presidential election has markets on edge, with polls indicating a tight race. Historically, periods of political uncertainty tend to benefit gold.  
Given the current environment—uncertainty in global politics, central banks easing, and ongoing conflicts—it’s hard to predict where gold will go next. But many analysts think gold’s rise could continue. With interest rates at historic lows and economic uncertainty showing no signs of disappearing soon, the conditions seem favorable for gold to remain in the spotlight.  
My Stock Pick for November: Element79  
Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) Gold is advancing in the precious metals sector, focusing on gold and silver. With both near-term production and long-term exploration projects, the company is poised to generate revenue while expanding its resource base. Its flagship Lucero Mine in Peru, known for its high-grade deposits, is set to resume production soon. Historically, Lucero produced 40,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually, with an average grade of 19.0 grams per ton in gold equivalent. The mine’s underground workings extend over 16 kilometers, highlighting its significant reserves.  
Element79 Gold has outlined an ambitious plan for its upcoming activities, starting with a financing round of up to CAD $2,000,000, aimed at funding the fall-winter work campaigns. The funds will be allocated with 60% towards drilling and 40% towards project management, operations, and investor relations. The company plans to kick off a 2,000-meter inaugural drilling campaign at the Clover project, building on results from 104 shallow holes to begin resource discovery.  
In addition, Element79 is focusing on completing due diligence for the tailings with the potential to generate immediate revenue through a Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) and Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA). The company also plans to negotiate community contracts to secure surface rights for 3 to 10 years, ensuring long-term access to mining sites.  
At the Lucero Mine, a 1,000-meter inaugural drilling campaign will target resource discovery while mapping and preparing for surface drilling by 2025. Furthermore, Element79 will assess data from Lucero, Clover, and tailings to refine its plans for 2025, including further drilling, MRE updates, and PEA preparations. The permitting process for plant construction, tailings processing, and surface drilling is expected to take 4 to 6 months, ensuring that the groundwork is laid for future operations.  
Gold or Treasury Bonds?   
Bank of America analysts suggest that the increasing U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio, along with rising bond yields, may push more investors toward gold. As the Treasury sells more bonds, yields rise, and bond prices fall. Historically, this would hurt gold, but now, even with higher rates, gold remains strong. In fact, BofA predicts gold could hit $3,000 per ounce, calling it the “ultimate safe-haven asset.”  
Gold has surged more than 30% this year, reaching $2,700 per ounce. This rise continues despite the U.S. budget deficit reaching $1.8 trillion and interest payments on the national debt climbing to $950 billion.  
As central banks worldwide diversify their reserves away from U.S. debt, gold’s appeal grows. With spending pressures from climate change and defense needs, the future may see gold as the last standing safe investment. Bank of America notes, “If markets become reluctant to absorb all the debt, gold may be the final safe-haven asset.”",0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1gzrq19/gold_reaches_an_alltime_high/

* MYNZ
   * Reverse split should be approved by now. 1-2 to 1-100 hanging overhead
   * Online accounts, hundreds pumping this. On Twits, Reddit etc. All new accounts
   * The have a good product, they generate some revenue, but last I checked they had only 900,000 in cash (maybe this changed)
   * Their products do not come to market in the EU or USA until 2025 and 2026 respectively (look at the timeline in their corporate deck.  They do generate some revenue.
   * Their recent agreement also seems very promising.
* CDT

      * Reverse split to be approved Dec 18
   * The sec filings disclose an Astra agreement. Very good.  Except, they are paying Astra - in shares, cash etc.
   * Sec filings disclose
      * Toxic lending (promissory notes) , at 12%!!!  Interest
      * Bridge loans
      * More loans
      * And horrid dilution at low levels.
* TNXP
   * First, I believe this company ran adds on stocktwits.  I believe I have seen MYNZ do this too. This is a new DIGUSTING way of tricking retail into buying.  When you see a stock advertised on Stocktwits - MASSIVE RED FLAG.
   * Very positive
      * **Tonix received its first payment from DTRA as part of its previously announced award from DTRA for up to $34 million over five years.**
   * The NDA approval is not a catalyst.  It is followed by a PDUFA date that is the date for approval. I see many claims December will see approval.  The PDUFA date will likely be mid 2025.
   * They did a 1-32 reverse split in June,  And diluted the living shit out of the stock.
      * July 2024, Tonix received net proceeds of approximately $3.5 million in a securities offering with certain institutional and retail investors.

pennystocks,Rakon (NZX: RAK) - Under-the-radar Kiwi tech,"Anyone else keeping an eye on Rakon (NZX: RAK)? This small but ambitious Kiwi company has been doing some big things lately, and I think it's worth a closer look. They've been making moves in some seriously high-growth sectors like space tech and AI, while also setting themselves up to benefit from the eventual 5G boom. Here’s why they’re on my radar:

1. They Turned Down a $391 Million Takeover Bid
Back in June, Rakon reportedly said ""no thanks"" to Skyworks Solutions’ $1.70 per share offer. That valued the company at a hefty $391 million NZD. This wasn’t just a casual rejection either—they’ve essentially signaled that they think they’re worth a lot more. Makes you wonder, are they prime for a higher bid down the line? Or maybe they’re gearing up for something bigger on their own terms?

2. Breaking Into the Space Game
Rakon’s making some serious inroads into the $1.53 billion space market. They were recently picked by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to provide their Master Reference Oscillator (MRO) subsystem for a mission aboard the International Space Station. That’s not just a vanity project either—it’s the kind of contract that can lead to a lot more down the road. Space is big business, and they’re putting themselves right in the middle of it.

3. Betting Big on AI
Everyone’s talking about AI, and Rakon’s not sitting on the sidelines. They’re beefing up their AI computing product line with stuff like their MercuryX oscillator, which offers precise timing and synchronization for data centers. With the insane demand for AI computing, this could be a smart play for Rakon to tap into a whole new revenue stream.

4. Waiting on the 5G Wave
We all know 5G is the future, but the rollout has been slower than expected. That said, Rakon’s tech is positioned perfectly for when the wave really hits. It might just be a matter of time before this becomes another growth driver for them.

Why I’m Interested
Rakon’s a small company punching well above its weight. They’ve got their fingers in some of the most exciting pies out there—space, AI, and 5G—and they seem to know their worth. The fact that they turned down a big takeover bid tells me they’re either extremely confident in their future or have something up their sleeve. Either way, it feels like they’re gearing up for some kind of breakout.

Not saying this is a slam dunk, but for me, Rakon’s one of those ""watch this space"" plays. It’s still under the radar for a lot of people, but if they execute even half of what they’re aiming for, I wouldn’t be surprised if the stock takes off.

What do you all think? Anyone else tracking this one?

pennystocks,"Looking Forward to a Good Week:  $OLB, $RCAT $UMAC
","Looking for Special Situation**s** can be very rewarding--especially when news/information comes out after the Friday close (see OLB below).  All three of these stocks have their own stories for investors/traders.

**$OLB, OLB Group, $1.95,** had significant news after the market close on Friday. One of the defendants, a bank, named in a long fraud litigation that OLB brought against the sellers of a CBD merchant portfolio had a Cease and Desist Orderissued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Again, **this information came out after the market closed and picked up by Alpha Wolf Trading** [https://youtu.be/xZtBMbOQ-44?si=83d82rc-aZo8j\_2m](https://youtu.be/xZtBMbOQ-44?si=83d82rc-aZo8j_2m).  Considering that OLB has only a market cap of only $4.2 million, the prospects for a successful outcome in this court case against the bank may have increased significantly.  

OLB is also in the process of spinning off its Bitcoin mining facility to OLB shareholders to be announced later.  This spinoff alone may be valued at 3X-4X  the current market cap of OLB  .Could be two Lotto tickers with this one considering its litigation AND a spinoff of a separately traded equity of the mining facility pending.

**$RCAT, Red Cat Holdings, $8.97,** was up 100% (on huge daily volume) in just the past week--courtesy of the company winning a long-awaited US Army contract for military drones. RCAT management has projected 2025 revenues of over $50 million BEFORE factoring in the just announced US Army contract valued over $250 Million over 5 years. **There is a case to be made that RCAT could book over $100 million in revenue in 2025**. This contract is just for the US Army--US Marines, US Navy, US Border Patrol, NATO and so on are most likely to follow. Now that RCAT is an approved vendor for a crucial weapon/combat asset that required extensive testing and soldier feedback, the other military branches will most likely follow the US Army 's lead. 

BTW--there are 4.12 million shares short as of November 17. Watch for research analysts to begin to follow Red Cat.

**$UMAC, Unusual Machines, $4.40,** looks like it is playing catch up with RCAT--up over 60% in the past 5 trading days. With a low of $1.13 in early July, UMAC is being discovered by investors.  The daily trading volume increases further attracts traders wanting that liquidity  . Almost like a delayed response to the understanding that **UMAC is a supplier of controller components to Red Cat Holdings** and will be an obvious beneficiary of the US Army drone contract won by RCAT.  The daily trading volume increases further attracts traders wanting that liquidity. The prospects for strong Quarter to Quarter revenue growth are high as Red Cat contracts are announced.

pennystocks,NOVONIX and PowerCo SE Sign Binding Offtake Agreement,"Offtake for a minimum of 32,000 tonnes of NOVONIX’s high-performance synthetic graphite material to be supplied to PowerCo from 2027-2031

BRISBANE, Australia, Nov. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NOVONIX Limited (NASDAQ: NVX, ASX: NVX) (“NOVONIX” or the “Company”), a leading battery materials and technology company, and PowerCo SE (“PowerCo”), today announced the signing of a binding offtake agreement for a minimum of 32,000 tonnes of high-performance synthetic graphite material. The material will be supplied to PowerCo over a five-year term starting in 2027.

Established by Volkswagen in 2022, PowerCo is committed to ramp-up global battery cell production. PowerCo oversees international factory operations, advances in cell technology, and vertical integration of the battery value chain. PowerCo has identified three gigafactory locations – Salzgitter in Germany, Valencia in Spain, and St. Thomas in Canada - with a combined capacity of up to 200 GWh/year. NOVONIX and PowerCo previously announced the signing of a non-exclusive Testing and Development Agreement in March 2024.

NOVONIX’s Riverside facility is poised to become the first large-scale production site dedicated to high-performance synthetic graphite for the battery sector in North America and is slated to begin commercial production in 2025, with plans to grow output to 20,000 tonnes per annum (“tpa”) to meet current customer commitments. Previously, the Company announced the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (“MESC”) awarded the Company a US$100 million grant and was selected for a US$103 million investment tax credit towards the funding of the Riverside facility.

The Company is also progressing plans to build a second production facility, in the southeastern United States, that will have an initial capacity of 30,000 tpa and plans to expand that facility to 75,000 tpa. NOVONIX remains in discussions with the DOE Loan Program Office (“LPO”) for an Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Program loan to support the construction of this new production facility. NOVONIX’s current plans call for total production to increase to at least 150,000 tpa of synthetic graphite material to accommodate anticipated customer demand.

Key Deal Terms

Offtake commitment is for a minimum of 32,000 tonnes over the five-year term of the agreement.

Products will be priced under a pricing structure that has been agreed between the parties.

The start of commercial supply is targeted to commence in 2027, subject to NOVONIX achieving agreed upon milestones regarding final mass production qualification and satisfying certain compliance criteria. NOVONIX must also secure financing commitments for the production facilities that will supply PowerCo product. If these milestones or requirements have not been satisfied, then PowerCo may terminate the agreement.

This announcement has been authorized for release by NOVONIX Chairman, Admiral Robert J. Natter, USN Ret.

pennystocks,Beyond Air (XAIR) Why I'm all in on them ,"Beyond Air (NASDAQ: XAIR) has been on my radar due to its innovative approach in the medical device sector, particularly with its LungFit® platform. While the company has faced significant hurdles, recent developments suggest a potential turnaround. Here's an honest look at the challenges they've encountered and the strides they're making:

Challenges Faced:

1. Financial Strain: Beyond Air reported a net loss of $14 million in a recent quarter, slightly narrowing from the $17.4 million loss in the previous year. This high cash burn rate, approximately $56 million in fiscal year 2024, has been a significant concern for investors. ​​


2. Nasdaq Compliance Issues: The company's stock price fell below the minimum bid price requirement, prompting a warning from Nasdaq. Failure to regain compliance could lead to delisting, affecting stock liquidity and investor confidence. ​​


3. Regulatory Hurdles: Securing the European CE mark for LungFit PH has been challenging due to recent updates in regulatory requirements, making the process longer and more complex. ​​



Positive Developments:

1. Revenue Growth: Beyond Air reported revenues of $798,000, an increase from $239,000 in the same quarter last year, indicating stronger financial health. ​​


2. Strategic Partnerships: The company is in talks with the Veterans Administration and Department of Defense hospitals, aiming to expand the reach of LungFit PH into major healthcare networks. ​​


3. Institutional Investment: George Soros’s hedge fund recently invested over $1.4 million in Beyond Air, signaling confidence from institutional investors. ​​


4. Cash Flow Projections: Beyond Air expects to achieve cash-flow positivity by the quarter ending March 2025, a critical milestone for financial sustainability. ​​



Conclusion:

While Beyond Air has faced significant challenges, their proactive approach to addressing financial strains, securing strategic partnerships, and attracting institutional investments paints a picture of a company striving for a turnaround. Their innovative LungFit® platform and ongoing efforts to expand into new markets make them a stock worth watching.

pennystocks,Altimmune (ALT) - Best Bull case,"Altimmune (ALT) looks like it has a promising weight loss drug that preserves lean mass

ALT just had their end of phase 2 meeting with the FDA, and they got a green light to go into phase 3 for their obesity drug pemvidutide. Pemvidutide’s lean mass preservation is best-in-class. Only 21.9% of the weight loss is from lean mass, ozempic’s semaglutide is 39.9%, which is why people end up getting Ozempic face, or look awkwardly skinny on Ozempic.

Pemvidutide is also highly effective in treating liver fibrosis because of the high ratio of glucagon to glp1. In fact, their liver fat reduction is more potent than MDGL’s resmetirom.

The market cap is extremely low still, only $600m. Carmot was a ph1 obesity drug when Roche bought them out for $2.7Bn. MDGL is currently ~$7Bn, VKTX ~5Bn, which pemV has MASH indication, and looks like it’ll work better than MDGL for the treatment of MASH.

To summarize, ALT’s Pemvidutide shows almost twice the muscle preservation of semaglutide and better MASH data than MDGL. The stock is very undervalued at $600m when comps are trading for 8x-12x that valuation.

options,Need Honest Opinions On This Strategy,"I have been researching credit spreads for some time and need people’s opinions on this strategy and whether or not it works if you tried it. I also need help coming up with some sort of risk management strategy while trading it. Here it is: 

weekly put credit spreads on SPY with 90% OTM probability. If we think about this from the angle of 
compound interest, the results can be astounding. 

Example: if I open a put credit spread tomorrow (11/29) on SPY that expires a week later (12/6) with 90% OTM probability I can make anywhere between 1% to 3.5% in gains. So to simplify the numbers and be more conservative, if we start with $100 and compound it at 1% a week for 52 weeks in a year that $100 will become ~$167, that’s a 67% gain on the money. 

Now the issue is thinking through the risk management and how to manage the couple of trades that will potentially go against me (need your advice here). 

Does anyone have experience with this and how realistic it is? The numbers seem promising but not sure how it is once it’s actually applied. ",6,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1h1yzq2/need_honest_opinions_on_this_strategy/
options,Trying to figure out the name of this strategy,"I’ve put together a strategy where I sell a put and buy a call on separate DTEs. According to OptionStrat, this is profitable if AMZN is > 205.76 on the first ED (12/20). Has anyone used this strategy? If so, what is it called? Looks like the downside is if AMZN starts to tank in the next month. 

ChatGPT calls it a “synthetic long position”. Here’s how they explain it. 

The option strategy where you sell a put with one date and strike price and simultaneously buy a call with a later expiration date and a higher strike price is commonly referred to as a synthetic long position with a time spread or calendarized synthetic long.

Components:

	1.	Sell a put (short put): This obligates you to potentially buy the underlying asset if the price drops below the put’s strike price before its expiration.
	2.	Buy a call (long call): This gives you the right to buy the underlying asset at the call’s strike price, but on a later date.

Characteristics:

	•	Directional Bias: The strategy is bullish since you expect the underlying asset’s price to increase.
	•	Time Spread: The use of different expiration dates introduces a calendar spread dynamic, where time decay impacts the short put and long call differently.
	•	Profit Goal: Ideally, you profit if the underlying rises toward the call strike price before the call’s expiration while the put expires worthless or is covered by an increase in price.

This strategy takes advantage of the time difference between the two options and can work well in scenarios where you expect a gradual price rise in the underlying.",5,8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h1yqid

Been investing profitably for some time now - so far avoiding options. I've searched, however I cannot find a post answering this exact question:

I've been analyzing my portfolio and researching risks. I am heavy on Bitcoin and am extremely bullish on it's future outlook (for multiple years now). I hold BTC ETF shares - not actual Bitcoin.   
  
That being said, I've recently become paranoid about the possibility of the underlying Bitcoin custodian getting hacked. None of the ETF's really offer any assurances here.

If I buy protective puts on the IBIT ETF (while owning it), the ETF gets hacked, and my ETF shares are now worthless, am I still able to sell the options and recoup my losses?

options, Is MicroStrategy’s Strategy Innovative Financial Engineering or Something Riskier?,"I’ve been digging into **MicroStrategy** (Ticker: MSTR) and its bold strategy of going all-in on Bitcoin—positioning themselves as a “Bitcoin proxy.” They’ve adopted a pure-play approach, using billions in low-interest convertible bonds (sometimes at 0%) to fund [massive Bitcoin acquisitions](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microstrategy-makes-record-breaking-bitcoin-084042808.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAITnZfmYGc_hWsrAN9TW9btBfpMrT9l2sRgYV8tpd7i45PIcC4TW-MJ3ueqnXfglWEfcmQcNnQ15Qmb7BuliSKOkcsKRCHddLb-Suzh5O4HYTg-smdaf-cAKHFWuvsJheahdS1ymmBC5ZPgNZSba489qkPOS17jX9j3lV_8aJzuk).

From what I understand, MicroStrategy sells stock volatility to convertible bondholders, who profit from the “Gamma game.” Meanwhile, retail shareholders often see it as a straightforward Bitcoin play, which seems to leave them exposed to significant downside risks, like dilution and price drops. Bondholders, on the other hand, are protected with senior claims and hedged positions.

I’m curious to hear your thoughts:

1. Could this model collapse if Bitcoin’s price or market volatility drops significantly, given its reliance on continuous capital inflows?
2. Do you see this as a clever piece of financial engineering—or is it closer to something riskier, perhaps a pyramid scheme....?

For context, I’ve looked into a few sources that break this down in more detail:

   * **Michael Saylor on Valuetainment (PBD Podcast)**: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n53qmZ84zC0&ab_channel=Valuetainment)

options,Thankful This Thanksgiving,"As we gather around the table this Thanksgiving, I thought it'd be fun to reflect on the things we, as options traders (specifically sellers), have to be thankful for. Here are the three pillars of our trading success:

**1. Volatility**

Volatility is the lifeblood of options selling. It's what creates those rich premiums we aim to collect. Without it, trades would feel more like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller than crafting high-probability setups. Whether it's a market shakeup or just the ebb and flow of the VIX, volatility gives us the edge we need to thrive.

**2. Liquidity**

Ever tried trading in a market with no buyers or sellers? Liquidity ensures that we can enter and exit positions with tight spreads and minimal slippage. It's the unsung hero of efficient trading. Options on stocks like SPY, AAPL, and MSFT remain a trader's paradise because liquidity is always on our side.

**3. Gaussian Distribution**

The good old bell curve underpins so much of what we do. While markets aren't always perfectly ""normal,"" probabilities derived from the Gaussian distribution give us the framework to make smart trades. It's the reason we sell premium knowing that most options expire worthless, and why we focus on trades with high probabilities of profit.

Happy Thanksgiving to all the traders out there! May your deltas stay neutral, your theta keep burning, and your portfolio grow steadily. What are you thankful for in the world of trading? Let’s discuss below!",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1h1sd8m/thankful_this_thanksgiving/

1. If I open a short nearly at market close, and I plan to close it at most one hour into the next trading day, what is the real risk of assignment and how can I estimate it? How does it differ if there is a high volatility event during the night like, lets say, an earnings announcement? If I get assigned, what would be my theoretical loss if I sold ATM? And what if I don't have the money to buy 100 shares, I suppose I need margin for that, right?
2. How does liquidity work when short selling options? Like, how difficult would it be for me to close my short position at market open? What would be a good average volume on a contract for it to be easy?

options,Closing the short leg only on a bull call debit spread ,"Hello, I have a theoretical question about closing the short leg on a bull call debit spread while keeping the long leg. I will be using either Robinhood or Thinkorswim. 

Let’s say I buy a bull call debit spread on XYZ stock at $240. 

I buy the $245 call for 25.00
I sell the $255 call for 22.00

It cost me 3.00 to enter the trade. 

If the stock drops significantly but I am still bullish, I will be negative on my long call but profitable on my short call. 

So, let’s just imagine I was profitable $200 on the short call and it is now priced at 24.00 instead of 22.00.

If I bought back just the short leg to close it and lock in profit on just the short leg, what actually happens mechanically in my account?

Would I need $2,200.00 free cash in my account to close it and be netted $2,400 since I was $200 in profit? Or what happens?

Also, yes I realize I will be at more risk keeping the long call open. But, what happens to that? Since I would no longer have a spread, would I need to fork up $2,500 to stay in the long call? What actually happens?

I’ve always closed the spreads as a whole and never individually so I’m just seeking context from those who have done it. Again, I will be using either Robinhood or Thinkorswim. 


Thanks!

options,Asking for directional options hedging advice,"So usually I buy directional otm options.

Lately I decided to introduce hedging 
Into my bets for example.

Let's say meta is 565. I bet it would hit 575.

So I buy two 575 calls at for ex $800 each totaling 1600. To hedge I would get one 555 put on same expiration or any put option that is similar premium to $800. Like maybe a put worth $780- $900 range.( Nothing too specific)

The idea was if it goes down a lot I can recoup some of the losses.

Like book value wise I thought 2:1 ratio would be fine.

The issue:

The idea sometimes works but sometimes it goes as follows.

Example. 4-5 days passed

Meta hit 575 and is still 10 days from expiration and I closed all my meta positions, but the put devalued so much it ate 90% or more of my profits from my calls being itm.

So my question is, should I buy deeper itm hedge and the 2:1 book value idea was flawed?

Should I be looking at specific Greeks instead of just premium.

options,Selling Deep ITM LEAPS,"Just had a thought as I was looking into covered call strategies - what is stopping me from selling deep DEEP ITM LEAPS on my position, using the credit to make a trade, and buying the call back to close it out? I understand the risk that the underlying rockets in price forcing me to cover at a loss but in the scenario where it stays flat/ decreases in price, is this not effectively a loan at 0% or even negative interest rate? For example, AAPL $5 Jan 2027 call contracts are going for \~$23K EACH - that's almost 1-to-1 debt to equity ratio based on today's closing price of the stock at $235. If I use the $23K credit to open and close the trade within a relatively short period of time and AAPL trades flat for that period, I would likely be able to buy back the call for the same amount (I recognize that bid/ask spread for deep ITM LEAPS might be wide but assume for the sake of the argument that this factor is negligible). This means I've pocketed from 1) the trade using the credit from the covered call and 2) (potentially) pocketed from buying to close the covered call itself. 



To clarify, I'm not looking to this do personally as I'm more leaning with the r/thetagang folks selling weeklies/monthlies, but I also can't be the only one who's amused by the thought of someone else trying this out either lol",3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1h1mpb4/selling_deep_itm_leaps/

options,Step by Step Guide on How I’d Start Trading Options,"Tl:Dr; Trading and options can be life changing but it’s hard. There’s nothing novel here, just a methodology that has worked for me. I use 4 steps in developing a trading strategy: Profit mechanism ID, PM Signal testing, Structure fitting, strategy development.

There are a lot of words in this because, well, trading isn’t easy and needs a lot of shit done right to work well. You can skip this entire wall of text if: you’re super lucky (keep doing that) or you prefer a simpler approach and don’t mind sacrificing performance in favor of ease. These two cases can skip all this nonsense. However, my goal was to find a methodology I could continually rely on year in and year out. I’ve had 16 full trading years with 2 negative (both sub 5%) and a CAGR of mid 20%.

I started trading in 2007 and like most people, thought it was going to be a simple path to making tons of money fast. Spoiler alert - it wasn’t.

Below is the exact process I’d follow if I were to start trading again. There is a LOT of detail missing here because the post is long as is. I can do a deeper dive if there’s interest.

**Foundation**. (skip this section if you have good financial discipline and mindset towards money)

Important note - as a new trader all below is an iterative process. There is a lot to do and it won’t be completely sorted for several years, but knowing to pay attention to it is a massive leg up.

1. Current state assessment. Boring yes, but important. This is where we get base finances in order. Savings rate (which is hands down the MOST important initial feeder to performance), expanding income, emergency savings, etc.
2. Landscape analysis. The reality of life can be disheartening at first. Money is hard to make and Santa isn’t real - shitty I know. However, to become successful at something, we’d do well to recon what we’re trying to do and understand the fate of those who have gone before. What are the probabilities of success? What are the traits of those who succeed vs what are the commonalities of those who fail. Use the information gathered here to inform your approach. Hop on SSRN, type in the terms: options, options trading, trading, stock market, investing, etc. and see what you can learn for yourself (not what you heard some random online rando said).
3. Goal setting. The next trap that catches just about everyone is the setting of absolutely fucking insane goals, they they believe are reasonable. The worst are those who feel they’re being conservative, “oh, I JUST want 1% per week!” not realizing they’re pursuing a 67.8% annual return. Now, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with having goals that are aggressive but we should go into them eyes wide open. So when setting your initial return goal, ask yourself - what have you demonstrated so far to base your metrics off of. If it’s nothing, then you don’t get to set aggressive goals. For me, I would genuinely pursue >0% return for my first year to start. The reason is when we set larger goals, we try to solve the problem in application which includes taking more risk, that we’re absolutely not prepared for. Next, I would plan what I want to have, in what timeframe. For example, we might want $5M within 30 years. It’s up to you to define, but the next step will serve to validate.
4. Roadmap generation. Next is reverse planning from where we want to land. This is where the reality check comes in. If we want to have $5M within 30 years and our starting principle is $1,000 with monthly savings of $250, at a standard return of 10% we land at $511K a REAL long way off. So now we need to use the three levers at our disposal: savings rate, income expansion, rate of return. In the beginning, I would use a standard market rate of return because the reality is most people will not outperform the market. We then need to either meaningfully expand our savings rate, income level, and ideally both. The earlier the sacrifices are made, the sooner you get to enjoy them. I became a millionaire before 30 using this approach from a trivial starting point and decent paying job, but nothing spectacular (Marine Officer).
5. Behavioral analysis. Understand who you are, your biases, decision making process etc. If you are unable to objectively evaluate yourself, you are going to get punished. The market will identify ALL of your weaknesses. If you’re impulsive, overly cautious, impatient, etc. You have to be self-aware to reconcile what you’re trying to do, the performance of what you’re doing, and successfully complete a root cause assessment and positively attribute.
6. Money mindset analysis. This wasn’t something I did until much later in my trading journey, after I hit my initial targets and had the very high class problem of feeling completely lost. Having a goal is great because you feel like the trade-offs are worth it. It provides meaning. After I hit my initial target numbers, everything I had spend the last decade plus working towards changed. Incremental increases in my net worth didn’t have the same impact as achieving financial freedom or being able to take care of my family. So I built an exercise to better understand myself and relationship towards money. I used three scenarios, base needs, current trajectory, excess. I then created a list of questions that I’d ask myself after mentally putting myself (truly visualizing and adopting the scenario, this step cannot be superficial) to assess what I truly valued. This created massive clarity for me.

**Strategy Development.**

Most of us jump into what settings to use on our MACD oscillators, or what DTE “is best”, etc. Meanwhile, the foundation of actual successful trading hasn’t been laid. These are the four steps I would take to do just that. The beauty once this step is complete, is the questions of “what strategy should I use”, or “what delta or DTE is best” become implicit.

Admin note. You need to start a trading plan and trade log to track and analyze this stuff. If you’re too lazy to do that, you’re going to get lazy results. It’s up to you.

1. Profit mechanism. This is the most critical step in the process. Positively attributing HOW a trade makes money. Price direction (up or down), volatility (up, down, variance), dividends, stock buybacks, correlation (pairs). It sounds simple but you’d be amazed how most traders think little about the implications for this step. For example, if I’m extremely bullish on a stock, it might make more sense to buy a call for the uncapped profit potential vs selling a put. Yet most of us get stuck into defaulting to something that might not be optimal.
2. Profit mechanism signal. This is where we test and track different signals that help us identify the profit mechanism and better understand the behavior. This is a game of matching things that are relevant. For example, if I’m testing a breakout price mechanism, that based on initial observation tends to last 3-9 days on average, using a 5 year, weekly chart is likely useless as is the 252D MA. Maybe we test things like volume relative to a short term average, or shorter term MAs, etc. After step 1, you should be logically refining what makes sense to test for signals. You can accelerate your testing by: eyeballing first (this is just visually reviewing a chart and see what stands out as common themes to give initial testing ideas, this CANNOT be trusted but is a reasonable starting point), then backtesting, then forward testing. Reminder, we’re not testing strategies here, JUST signals. Why the emphasis on profit mechanism and signals? Because if you don’t get this right, it doesn’t matter if you sell a put or buy a call and the stock goes down - you’re still wrong. We’re building the initial inputs to track expected return. Win rate, loss rate, average win $ and average loss $. Remember, options simply amplify things. So you can track your average sizes based solely on price movement to start, it’s completely fine.
3. Outline structures. NOW is when we introduce base structures we thing might make sense. Going back to the price direction up, breakout profit mechanism. We know we’re trading something that is going up, so buying stock, buying calls, selling puts all fit. This is a fine starting point. Once we get comfortable, we can get a bit more complex with our structure outlines. Here we can explore basic ideas via an eyeball test, backtest, and forward test. This step helps us refine what deserves to become a strategy based on step 1 and 2.
4. Build strategy. Finally, we can take the best idea or two and build strategies around them. This is where we test tons of variations to find an optimal set up (reminder, optimal doesn’t mean best performing inherently, that might just show an overfit configuration. robustness matters). Back to the breakout example. Maybe we found defining a tight exit below recent consolidation has a manageable loss rate (say 40%) with an average loss of 5% of entry price. Win rate was 60% with an average win of 25% of entry price. While the short puts might work fine, long calls seem to be a better fit based on these metrics, since there’s a stop involved that doesn’t allow us to fully benefit from the larger profit window of a short puts and the upside has larger potential which the short puts sacrifice. To test the long call strategy, we need to test some key inputs: DTE, theta, and delta. We’ll want to pay attention to gamma as well. Remember, greeks give us tremendous insight into HOW a position will behave - that’s their purpose. We can backtest and forward test here to test all different configurations of DTE and deltas (while tracking theta and gamma). In this way, it’s not a guessing game, it shouldn’t be. We might find that mid-duration options greater than 30DTE balances theta decay and gamma but going too far out might decrease liquidity and add unnecessary expense if our average total holding duration (identified from step 1 and 2) is <40DTE.

If this sounds like a lot of steps and work, it is. See the first thing I said. Do not allow the low barrier to entry into trading deceive you, especially options which add complexity. To achieve long-term success you will need to work as hard at this as any other high performing career with far more pitfalls and less support. As a trader you will wear many hats: researcher, analysis, risk manager, psychologist, planner, etc. The cool part though, is your destiny is entire in your own hands.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1h1gkvz/step_by_step_guide_on_how_id_start_trading_options/

options,Implied Volatility of ATM Options with 0 DTE,"Want to get some insights from some of the more experienced vets on this sub on a few questions I had regarding how ATM options are priced.

  
Hypothetical: 

Let's say you're trading 0 DTE on SPY. You sell a straddle at the open with the strike prices being as close to at-the-money as possible. Say the underlying is at $600 and you sell a call for $2 and a put for $2. This implies that the market is assuming the underlying will hover around $598 to $602 for the day (please correct me on this point if I'm mistaken). Then, let's say something happens (i.e. news comes out that Trump is dissolving the Fed and will personally set interest rates himself). Market starts to tank and underlying goes immediately to $590. With that in mind, would it be correct to assume that the price of ATM options would be many many multiples of the original $2 that the day began with? Like given the news, market makers will likely think that the market can go much higher or lower in any direction, no? I ask this because, intuitively, I think the answer is yes, but I'm getting caught up with the fact that it's 0 DTE. Like I guess that could hamper it's movements somewhat, no? 

  
To be honest, I think i'm overthinking it so want some more experienced redditors to weigh in here. Thanks!",2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1h1gqx9/implied_volatility_of_atm_options_with_0_dte/
options,Portfolio Tail Hedge in Practice,"I've been asked to construct a basic tail hedge strategy (the guy who was doing it left the firm).

I'd like to improve on his approach by at least breaking even, and if possible even making some money? (We would spend about $1m/yr on premium to just watch it decay).

I thought one approach would be to buy otm spx emini puts and hedge with futures- and rebalance this hedge every, say +/- 3% move in the index. I wrote a script in Python to back test this and it did seem profitable. 

I guess I'm struggling to pitch the trade, especially the ""why"" when it comes to a specific strike/expiry.

options,Roast my Strategy,"Roast my Strategy, as the tile says.

I day-trade the Dax.

Fibonacci + EMA + RSI Confluence + Volume as a topping

The Setup:

1️⃣ **Fibonacci Levels**: I plot retracements/extensions (61.8%, 127.2%, etc.) on the daily chart to find key support/resistance zones.

2️⃣ **EMA 14**: If the price aligns with a Fib level and EMA 14, I take it as a strong confirmation.

3️⃣ **RSI**:

* **Oversold (<30)** near support? Likely bounce.
* **Overbought (>70)** near resistance? Possible pullback.
* **Divergences** RSI vs. price action is a key trigger for me.

Why I Think It Works:

* Fibonacci gives me levels.
* EMA 14 confirms the trend.
* RSI tells me if the market is stretched or hiding reversals. When combined, they make broader sense.

 The Rules I Follow:

* I wait for <2/3 confluence (2/3, or all three align).
* I always check volume and candlestick patterns for extra confirmation with more weight on volume.
* No confluence? No gut feeling either? No trade.

options,ACHR options strategy ,"DD-Strategy for ACHR Call Holders to Build Long-Term Positions & Manage High IV

Alright, ACHR believers, let’s strategize. With the recent rally, high IV (Implied Volatility), significant short interest, and promising analyst forecasts, there’s a unique opportunity for those holding $2.5, $3, or $3.5 calls to position themselves long-term while keeping their cost basis low. And for anyone new looking to jump in, read on for a plan that avoids getting burned by the volatility.

# 1. Big News on Manufacturing Plant

ACHR is set to open its **highly anticipated manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia**, where the company aims to scale up production of its Midnight aircraft. This plant positions Archer as a serious contender in the eVTOL space, ready to transition from prototype to commercial production. Unlike competitors like Joby, Archer’s ramp-up is happening in a **leaner market cap environment** with greater potential for outsized growth once manufacturing kicks off.

# 2. Analyst Price Targets: The Road Ahead

Here’s what analysts are forecasting for ACHR over the next year, based on the latest data:

* **Minimum Price Target:** $4.50 (-40% downside from current levels)
* **Average Price Target:** $9.28 (+22.72% upside)
* **Maximum Price Target:** $12.50 (+65.34% upside)

The average target suggests room for significant growth even after the recent rally, while the max target indicates even greater potential upside if Archer executes its roadmap effectively (manufacturing, FAA milestones, partnerships).

# 3. Archer vs. Joby: The Underdog Advantage

While Joby has a larger market cap (\~$5B+ vs. Archer’s \~$2B), Archer has **significantly more short interest**—around **25% of the float is shorted**, compared to Joby’s \~10-12%. This makes ACHR an ideal candidate for a **short squeeze**, especially with catalysts like the manufacturing plant, FAA milestones, and partnerships (including the lesser-discussed **India partnership with InterGlobe Enterprises**, parent company of IndiGo).

For believers, this underdog status presents an opportunity. A smaller market cap and higher short interest mean that any positive catalyst could drive outsized moves compared to Joby.

# 4. High IV – Handle With Care

The IV is **extremely high right now**. This is great for those already sitting on ITM calls with big gains (like $2.5, $3, or $3.5 strikes), but it’s a double-edged sword. If there’s a sudden pullback, the IV will crush, and option values can drop drastically, even if the stock doesn’t move much.

* **For Current Call Holders**: Consider selling some of those calls with 1000%+ gains and using the proceeds to exercise others into shares. This not only locks in profits but also gives you a solid long-term position in shares while keeping your cost basis at $4 or below.
* **For New Option Buyers**: Be cautious! The high IV means options are very expensive right now, and a pullback could wipe out value quickly. If you’re bullish, consider either **waiting for a pullback** to lower IV or buying shares instead to avoid IV decay.

# 5. Why Owning Shares Matters

Exercising calls into shares has a twofold benefit:

* It adds **buying pressure** to the stock, potentially fueling a further squeeze against shorts.
* Shares don’t lose value due to IV crush or time decay like options do.

For those who already have a cost basis of $4 or lower, stay focused on the long-term. Even if there’s a pullback, the fundamentals (manufacturing plant, FAA milestones, partnerships) could drive this stock much higher in the coming months and years. As long as things go as planned, ACHR has the potential to climb rapidly, and holding shares positions you to benefit fully.

# 6. A Reminder for Long-Term Believers

ACHR isn’t just a quick trade. This is a company with real catalysts, solid partnerships (Stellantis, Delta, InterGlobe), and the manufacturing infrastructure to deliver on its promises. It’s also in a **high-growth phase** where being smaller (and more shorted) than Joby offers unique opportunities for outsized returns.

For the long-term crowd, focus on cycling gains wisely:

* Lock in profits from high-IV options.
* Build share positions with proceeds.
* Support the squeeze dynamic and the company’s growth trajectory.

This way, you’re positioned for both the immediate rally and the long-term potential of Archer becoming a major player in the eVTOL space.

# TL;DR:

ACHR is in a unique position with its manufacturing plant, short interest, leaner market cap, and bullish analyst forecasts. High IV means options are risky now, so lock in gains, build long-term share positions, and wait for better entry points if you’re looking to buy options. For stockholders with low cost bases, stay steady—this could climb much higher with the right catalysts.

*If I missed anything or got something wrong, please weigh in—always happy to learn and hear from others! Not financial advice, just thoughts from a fellow believer. Do your own research, manage your risk, and let’s take ACHR to the moon!* 🚀",34,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1h00avq/achr_options_strategy/

options,Volatility decay in Options,"Leverage ETFs suffer from volatility decay hence their performance in any period longer than the rebalancing frequency is dependent on the realized volatility for that period. The higher the realized volatility, the more their performance suffers. Some may call this ""path dependence"" too, but it's really about realized volatility (magnitude of ups and downs) and not about the sequence of ups and downs.

I know option pricings factor in implied volatility but do options', particularly LEAPS, value depend on realized volatility or path that the underlying took? I'm less focused about the pricing between different strike values but more on how price of the same strike progresses through time.

options,I know I screwed up but I need  Advice!!!,"

I’m not new to this and have been profitable these last couple of months. There are still something’s I don’t understand when it comes to options tho. 

RTPX has been trading sideways for a while. Since it’s small, yesterday, I took a Call and wanted to exercise it at some point to sell covered calls on its way back down (a new strategy I’ve been wanting to try) 
I have a lot of questions and If anybody with experience can give me some advice/insight on what’s going on, I will greatly appreciate it.😬

Questions:

-> I understand that large spreads exist, but WHY DID MY CONTRACT START AT -98% THE MOMENT I OPENED IT???

-> The one time the contract went up, was this morning, it went up to +$26 and then right back down to -$138. My simulated breakeven price was at 3.05 and now it’s at 3.15 after one day, contract doesn’t expire until December 20th. WHY did BE change so quickly???

-> Why does Robinhood show my simulated profit is at -$8.00 right now but my current profit is still at -$138???

-> Current price is still above my strike price so would it still be a good idea to exercise for the 100 shares at some point???

->>> The odds of price continuing up are still high so should I still hold? How should I deal with this situation and what can I do to avoid this in the future????

options,IBIT liquidity questions for May 2025 calls,"Hi everyone,

I'm interested in buying around 460 contracts of IBIT $65 strike price for May 2025.

The bid/ask is 9.00/9.20 which is very good, but the open interest is 562 and volume is 212, which I understand is low?

The thing is, IBIT JUST released these options 2 business days ago so I'm guessing that's probably why, but I'm worried about liquidity.

If I were to place a limit order of $9.20 for 460 contracts at the ask price, would it be filled relatively quickly? And would I have any issues while trying to sell it when we get closer to that May 2025 expiration if the price of IBIT doubles ? (which would mean the contract value would 4x)

Worst case scenario is I'd have to go for the $60 strike price which has around 10x more liquidity (3340 open interest and 1531 volume) but i'd lose out on an alright amount of money incase IBIT doubles in value .. ($100k to $200k)

I'm new to options trading (however, I have taken comprehensive online courses and done some paper trading) as I haven't placed an order with real money as of yet.

On the Webull platform, every few months it gives me x2 $65 USD options trading vouchers (part of a promo as I transferred my shares to Webull some months ago).

I previously had them going to waste as I didn't know much about options. They would just expire.

However, I figured I may as well use them up this time and spend minimal, if anything (the voucher works by initially paying for the premium and then being reimbursed after the trade fills).

Given that I don't really have much to lose (happy to still spend a little up to $15-20usd or so after the trading voucher), what suggestions do you all have? I've been enthusiastic about rocket lab, but there's limited volume for some that fit my criteria.

Heres what I see as the main downside risks, let me know if you think of others (unrelated to business operation risk, Im aware of those risks and willing to take the position without hedging those):

1. Trump dies / is overthrown / loses power in some way
2. Trump dilutes non-insider ownership in DJT
3. A macro event that crushes the whole market regardless of the status of DJT operations

What would be the best way to hedge against these risks or others that I missed? Buying LEAPs on DJT are cost prohibitive at the moment. I tried going on Polymarket to see if I can bet on his lifespan, but didnt see any props. Any other ideas? Thanks in advance.

1) how does this work from a MM perspective? Do you balance daily? Instantly? Only upon expiration?
2) if MMs are biggest volume, how do stocks even go beyond the trend of keeping things in check? I mean, when does this end, only upon expiration of the initial position they sold?

I have 300 shares and 4 June 20, 2025 Contracts. I bought those calls on Halloween so they're up 500% and 200% respectively. My shares are up over 100%, too.

I am obviously way deep ITM and am uncertain of the best way to continue to build a bullish position.

Premiums on LEAPS even out to December next year are pretty high although I do believe it will keep pumping, I don't want to tie up a ton more capital for now.

I think it has a low chance of dipping down and I wouldn't mind getting more shares at say a $17-20 cost basis, so I'm considering selling puts.

However, the way it's been running put premiums are pretty low and I'd have to expose myself to having to buy hundreds of more shares to cover even $1,000 worth of premiums which is also annoying. Although I do have up to \~$6k in margin I can use if I had to execute the puts. If I end up in that situation, I firmly believe the stock will rise at a higher % than my margin interest (8%)

options,125% ---> 190% Compounding Gains Journey Continues,"Last post was sharing the realization the only way will get ahead is by compounding the gains, unrealized gains are just that. I thought would need to await market cycles to reset, turns out there's a much easier way to compound gains. Here's my two compounding plans:

1. Await market cycles: Using Fear and Greed index was planning on opening swings + LEAPS when fear was high, closing swings when greed ran high again. The LEAPS coast if market continues to run, the swings compound each big fear dump using 45-75dte to ensure plenty of time.
2. Compounding calls: Identify current runners, buy OTM calls, close once deep in-profit, reopen OTM with even more contracts using the profit, now are compounding calls as price runs.

I've discovered my goal will be much easier now, instead of awaiting for market cycles to reset can find runners and compound calls as price action runs. Eventually, price will stop running and lose but two cycles is possible in a week even, potential which greatly surpasses awaiting market cycle resets.

https://preview.redd.it/2lbmfi22643e1.png?width=956&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d7a3dbf720016ab09a8fc289c00b39998104cac

Here's results of recent, was stuck at 65% for the longest time while still testing all the different option structures. Pushed to 125% or the first big peak, shared results then and now we're pushing 190%+. First year learning options, things only really clicked on deepest of level this past couple months.

**GAME PLAN:**

1. **Market cycle:** Holiday week will do good, Dec. 08-15th tax harvesting sell-off begins and CPI will release Dec. 11th, I'll close all positions Dec. 06th or Friday. This is the equivalent to exiting position to avoid holding through an earning's report, this is a binary event and smart risk management is just avoiding binary events so that's the plan. Santa rally begins 26th, will reopen then. I'll skip first week of Jan. as well, get idea on sentiment starting the year. My most important factor is only trading when market conditions align, if the weather is bad I don't fish.
2. **Compounding calls**: Buying OTM calls on runner like ACHR, selling the calls for profit next day, reopening again OTM with more contracts, able to compound calls. Market conditions must align. Finding these companies requires following hype sentiment. There's site use called swaggystocks which shows the tickers discussed on WSB in the last 12hr, 24hr and 7days. If catch a ticker which just won a contract, has massive DD going viral, then I'll do use my own judgement and decide if it's sound. Personal preference is key to avoid the junk that's hyped. I won't touch MARA for example I don't mess with Bitcoin and share Buffett's view.

It's so important to naturally close calls which have generated excessive profit, it's smart risk management, but the company may still have potential to run so naturally need to leave a play open. Buying again OTM, using the profit from first play, basically house money, buying more contracts, there's a natural compounding nature to just smart risk management and knowing when to stay in a trade. So there's my timeline for timing the market and how will find the companies will trade next.

1. Am I doing the comparison OK? I tried to follow the recommendations in the sub, but want to hear you opinion for this specific case
2. Are there any other factors that would make you choose one option over the other? (Maybe IV, theta, other?)
3. Let’s say I have 10 other stocks I don’t mind doing the wheel on. How can I find the one that gives me better ROI given the same risk (if it is possible).

The above companies are just a sample companies.
What I am trying to ask is this: given many similar factors: underlying price, strike price, Deltas, premiums, what other important metrics are you looking at when deciding what options to prefer to sell over other options?

For example, if there is an abnormal premium possibility, how to spot that particular option out of others?",8,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1gz1cgi/comparing_stocks_for_the_wheel/

I noticed a weired similartiy between the follwoing stocks. $TSLA, $CVNA and $PLTR.

On Friday the 22.11.2024 all of those stocks rose in the first hour of the trading day without any news and on somewhat low volume. (CVNA volume was elevated)

Comparing the volume distribution, they look exactly the same. So to me this seems like market maker action and someone covering their losses in shorts or call sellers covering their losses.

So I finally had the chance to login and unlocking Legend and although it is customizable (to an extent), it STILL lacks a variety of chart overlays and indicators.

I was sure that Robinhood would unload a ton of indicators that are found in other reading platforms, but it seems as though they thought the new interactive chart would be enough to carry it's weight on its own.

Nope. Not even close.

You're only allowed 4 indicators total and 6 overlays. 6 overlays are a bit much, however, 4 indicators doesn't do it justice. For me, I like to have the following indicators giving me information: TTM, W/R, AROON, CCI, & EFI.

W/R doesn't exist on Legend, nor does TTM, W/E, or EFI... bummer.

Additionally, I only use Pivot Points & 4 SMAs (10, 20, 50, & 200).

All in all, I don't believe Legend is worth it's own weight. You have more indicators and options on the mobile app... Which is crazy to me.

I'm a subscribed Finviz user so I'll continue to use that chart scheme versus Legend until serious changes are added to it.

Other than that, what are your thoughts on the new Legend.

Please don't argue on this thread or I'll just delete it or lock it. Be civil and exchange information that will help us all.

options,$70k of premium shorting 12/20 $MSTU options,"Y'all know $MSTR and $MSTU price action have been insane, but their options premiums have been insaner.

So I'm taking this high IV opportunity.

I still hold 600 shares of MSTU, and have 6 calls sold against them for a total premium of **$28.2k**.

I sold 29 puts across $80, $100, $110, and $120 strike prices for a total of **$42.2k.** This requires $243k of cash set aside, making this a 17.4% return on cash in one month.

Fun fact: The cash used to secure short puts continue to earn the 4.5% APR interest in Fidelity's money market fund!

Chart attached: I like to mark the strike price lines on a chart just to track visually. Thicker green lines indicate strikes where I have more contracts open. *Golden Zone* indicates the range where everything would expire worthless.

# Interesting stats:

* If MSTU tanks below $80 and I get assigned on all my MSTU puts, I will be purchasing 2900 shares at a cost basis of $83.71. When adding in the 600 shares I still hold,I will have 3500 shares at a cost basis of $95.14.
* My max profit if MSTU closes above $295 on 12/20 will be \~$99k: Collect $70k premium + $29k in capital gains on the 600 shares.

options,Growing small account using price action to scalp options - downsides?,"Hello fellow Options trading experts, 

Newbie options trader here. I have been trading equities purely based off price action and have decent scalping handle. Definition of **""Decent""** for my trading style - I am sure experts would need something to benchmark off of. Repeatable patterns, repeatable setups, tight risk management - tight stop once entered a trade, only enter on pullbacks in a trend (short term/long term trend), trade (most likely) would go ITM with a short span (few seconds to a few mins) during intra day trading, take profits on at least 1:2 R:R minimum - unless price action dictates otherwise, i.e. if ticker does not do as expected to in a short duration of time, out with a paper cut. 

  
I have been learning PA trading to grow a small account. One way among many to do this is by trading options. What downsides based off price action trading would folks recommend to be wary of? I have captured a few and it's downsides below. P.S. I know SC volatility helps to grow a small account too but I have not done a deep dive in SC price action to trade those stocks, mostly into mid/large cap equities PA trading only - at the moment. 

  
**1. Black swan event - account blowup**

**2. One large red candle - all gains gone, margin call**

**3. One bad news headline - done w/ the small account** 

**4. Avoiding trading open and last 30 mins to reduce risk, volatility exposure at least at this early stage in getting a handle on things**

**5. Revenge/Stubborn trading - learned this the hard way to accept ""it's ok to be wrong"" so try to avoid this but as anybody else, still guilty of this sometimes but not as much as I used to previously. Also for options this is lethal with huge downside.** ",11,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1gyetzd/growing_small_account_using_price_action_to_scalp/

This is actually quite a significant value while the whole ""business model"" of MSTR is to use leverage (through selling debt and diluting their shares) to buy and pop-up BTC's value.  
So I just have quite a dumb question: will MSTR be forced to sell their BTC if it goes well below this average purchase price?

cryptocurrency,Bybit mixed Apex APE with APECoin APE in their halal token certification ,"Bybit has released a list of tokens deemed halal (permissible) according to Islamic Sharia law. However, there seems to be a significant error in their listing.
The platform has mistakenly included ApeX, a perpetual decentralized exchange (DEX) that is explicitly forbidden (haram) under Islamic law. This oversight is particularly concerning as Bybit initially used the ApeX name and logo in their listing but on detail page bybit to refer to ApeCoin, a cryptocurrency associated with NFTs.

I decided at the start of 2024 to see how my account looked. It was news to me to discover that both Rally and Nu were no longer supported by Coinbase. I have very little money in them, but anytime I see my allocation, it bugs the ever-living fuck out of me. I want to get rid of them, but I’m told to go to Coinbase Wallet. Well, I did that, and it’s confusing to me. I’m not quite sure how to proceed, and I haven’t found too many articles that were helpful for me on doing this. How can I transfer Rally and Nu from Coinbase to Coinbase Wallet, convert to Ethereum or Bitcoin, and then send back to Coinbase?

cryptocurrency,"12 Years Ago, on Nov, 28 2012 The First Bitcoin Halving cut Block Reward from 50 to 25 BTC (Bitcoin at $12.20)","What a journey, right?

In the months after the first halving in 2012, the network hash rate and difficulty declined as less profitable miners turned off machines to reduce costs. However, by early 2013, Bitcoin kicked off its first major bull run, surging from $13 to ~ $1,000 by year's end.
The fears of miner capitulations were proven largely unfounded. The network hummed along, and the Bitcoin community learned an early lesson: Halvings are bullish for the Bitcoin network and the price of Bitcoin.
Total Bitcoin supply on Nov. 28, 2012: 10,500,000

Some more text to keep the bot happy.

The first Bitcoin halving sliced off the first 50% of the Bitcoin mining reward – from 50 to 25 Bitcoins per block. Back then, the impact of the halving was still not priced in. The community was watching anxiously, as the closing price on the halving day was $12.20.

cryptocurrency,Any banks or credit/debit cards you guys like to use for purchases? Unable to purchase crypto. ,"I have credit cards and debit cards for a total of five different banks, and when attempting to add them or make any crypto coin purchases at all, I am met with technical errors preventing me from proceeding. 

I thought of the idea of moving my money to a “proxy debit card” somehow to buy crypto. 

Are there any banks as of 2024 or debit/credit cards that are more friendly than others for crypto purchases?

Sorry if someone posted about this already…I saw a previous post where someone used Capital One credit to buy crypto but that’s one of my banks and my cards haven’t been working. I have two credit cards with them. It appears what I read was a little outdated.

cryptocurrency,NiceHash is scamming,"Anyone thinking of using NiceHash should review recent reddit posts here regarding how difficult they make their system to withdraw your earned BTC, in my opinion, with hopes you will give up so they can pocket it and supposedly ""donate it to charity"".

Like many others, I started receiving emails that NiceHash was now charging me BTC as some kind of maintenance fee for my account being inactive. NiceHash charges about $10 per month for the sin of taking up 1 kilobyte of data in their database. After two months I had noticed the emails that this was happening so decided to login and check on it. I had $315 worth of BTC (after $20 had been eaten by their fees of course).

I of course decided to immediately move the BTC somewhere less scammy but like all others, was met with 2FA requirements and KYC verifications to do basically anything on the account. Someone had mentioned that you don't have to do KYC if you close the account. I went down this route because I'm not jumping through their many hoops and pitfalls. I created a Lightning Network wallet to withdraw to and their system allowed me to progress all the way through to submitting the lightning invoice, and then fails because the account needs 2FA. I enabled that and then am locked out for 3 days before it allows any further actions. Ok.

Three days later I attempt the exact same steps again by going to close account which then directs to withdraw. Except this time, the account just immediately closes with the only message being an email to me that says the account is now closed. Can no longer login to it. Welp, where did my BTC go? Opened a ticket with support to be told that I ""chose to donate the BTC to charity on account closing"". LOL! What? Now they want me to submit a selfie holding a sign with my personal information like it's a reddit AMA or something AND complete the KYC process, to then ALSO charge me $10 as an ""administration fee"" to restore the account and ""recover"" the funds ""donated"" to ""charity"".

Nothing during this process states anything about charity. So it appears that NiceHash has this convoluted system setup to thieve as much BTC as possible from people that used to use their service back in its hayday.

im not gonna go into detail about all the talking points, but in one of the points, it says that bitcoin ISN'T actually de-centralized.

as quoted:  
  
""The “hard cap” of 21M for BTC can easily be changed by altering a parameter in the source code. Less than 6 people have commit access to the repo so BTC’s source code control is centralized. It’s entirely possible if BTC existed long enough to the point where block rewards weren’t enough to motivate miners, and transaction fees became incredibly high, that influential players in the community would advocate increasing the cap and reinstating higher block rewards. So there are absolutely situations where the max amount in circulation could be increased.

cryptocurrency,SanusCoin (SAC)... legit or not? Im very confused,"So first off Id like to say that I have no idea about Crypto. I just recently finished school, Im 19 years old. There is a man that offered to help my mom with some personal problems etc but then one day he told me he has a great offer for me. He is a wealthy businessman, he has Bitcoin and stuff so probably a millionaire. Well he told me about this Italian/Swiss company called SanusLife that is all about ecological stuff and everything. Well you used to get Sanuscredits when you bought some of their products (Water ionizers) which you can turn into SanusCoins. They are on the bitcoin Blockchain, the company is about 15 years old now.

They have an App called Sanuspay 3.0 and stuff, 1 SAC is worth 1.17 USD today. There are a maximum of 777.777.777 SAC available btw. So their aim is for you to be able to pay with the coin in various stores with the SanusPay function that is slowly rolling out and stuff. It does look kinda serious, Ive been to online meetings with a lot of people and everything. Oh and btw you need to pay 3.5 Dollars fee to create your account, apparently for some kind of administration fee for NAOCOIN some internet company. Oh and this is a MLM where you get 1000 free Sanuscredits for inviting people with your link to register and stuff, those 1000 get turned into about 6 SAC 

Its just that this man has been kind off Too nice to me for a stranger?? He keeps yapping about life and how family is important and stuff, and how I could help the SanusLife brand get more popular in Serbia and how this is a once in a lifetime offer and why wouldnt he help me, young people deserve a chance and now Im part of the Team Alpha... basically repeating the same stuff everytime he calls me on WhatsApp or Telegram (The usage of WhatsApp and Telegram also makes it kinda shady? Or is that just me)

So yesterday he called me saying how I should make 2 payments, one for 30 Dollars and one for 40 so I can get much more opportunities and cashback and whatnot (apparently some cashback of 30%?) and on top of that I should deposit 500 Dollars for some kind of voucher and get a return of 3x that much in the first month of SanusPay launch, and I should do it either today or tomorrow.

So me being me, a confused 19 year old, I dont know if this could become the next best thing or if its just another MLM scam or Ponzi scheme. You cant exchange the SAC to USD at the moment which also worries me. And the way how the man wants me to extend the marketplace to serbia and telling me not to stress cuz we will do everything step by step and I will be doing this for years... It kinda makes me want to block him and dip. I always panic when thinking about having to deal with anything for multiple years.

Does anyone have any advice what I could do here? Anyone ever heard of SanusLife? They dont have a rich online presence, just their own website and App and thats pretty much it. But inside the Telegram and whatsapp groups and Zoom Meetings it looks pretty serious.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!",0,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1h1z5cl/sanuscoin_sac_legit_or_not_im_very_confused/

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the 34th monthly report for the 2022 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, ADA, USDC, XRP, LUNA, DOT, and AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 NOVEMBER Pre Melt-Up Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for nearly 7 years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **OCTOBER Highlights:** \- Mostly red month. Only **BTC** and **BNB** in positive overall territory. **SOL** getting close to break even. 2022 Top Ten is the worst performing portfolio, by far.
* DCA'ing just once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 7 years has produced much better returns than S&P 500 over the same time period **198% vs. 66%** (see below for details)

# Month Thirty-Four – Down -44%

https://preview.redd.it/yc0hgdv3593e1.png?width=1099&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0a03fe66252477a65f770d15cd05a40ca444f93

The 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, BNB, Solana, ADA, USDC/UST, XRP, LUNA/LUNC, DOT, AVAX.**  

October highlights for the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio:

* Mostly red month, with the exceptions of **BTC** and **SOL**
* **BTC** solidly in first place with **BNB** in second
* Nearly three years into the Experiment, most coins haven’t reached their break even point yet
* The 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is the worst performing of the seven [Top Ten experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/), -44% as a whole.

# October Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in ranking thirty-four months into the 2022 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/4lxs11eb593e1.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=3717d5b8e4e40ca30a6c360091e89916e3523401

With a few notable exceptions, there has been remarkably little movement in rank after nearly three years. 

# October Winners and Losers

***October Winners*** – **BTC** (+10%) and **SOL** (+8%) easily outperformed the field in October.

***October Losers*** – **XRP** (-18%) fell the most this month.

# Overall Update: BTC maintains lead over BNB.  Only BTC and BNB are in positive territory. LUNC worst performing in the 2022 Portfolio and worst performing crypto of all the Top Ten Experiments.

**BTC** (49%) maintained its lead over second place **BNB** (+12%).  **SOL** is in third place at -2% since January 2022, nearing break even point.

Ever since **LUNC’s** (then known as **LUNA**) [crash in May of 2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5/), it has remained hopelessly at the bottom, worth a fraction of a cent.  The initial $100 invested in **Luna** thirty-four months ago is worth $0.0001 today – the worst performance of any coin in any of the seven Top Ten Experiments, by far.  It’s hard to remember/believe that **LUNA** was the highest performing Top Ten Crypto of the first quarter of 2022, before the crash.

Additionally, at -44%, the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is the worst performing of the seven [Top Ten experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/).

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/0dqn9l6g593e1.png?width=303&format=png&auto=webp&s=c425ed5afdc5ac49496a6f63847691f04f59fdd9

Overall, the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is down -44%.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2022 is now worth **$555.** 

There hasn’t been a positive overall ROI month yet, although the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio flirted with the break even point in [March 2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3/).  

# A note on USDC/UST

In retrospect this was not my best idea: I was a bit bored of simply holding a stablecoin in the Top Ten as I’ve been doing since 2019 and thought I’d showcase some of the possibilities available in crypto to build on stablecoin holdings.  My plan was to start nice and easy with trusted CeFi platforms, taking advantage of sign up bonuses, then move to more advanced DeFi strategies.  As fate would have it, I decided to showcase the TerraLuna chain converting my USDC to UST and then staking with Anchor.

It was all going pretty well until May 2022. Then the LUNA implosion happened. My **UST** is now worth $2.24, down -98%.

It’s a good reminder that anything can and does happen in crypto and we should all continue to be careful. I’m thankful that the lesson only cost me $100:  I know a lot of other people got hit much, much harder.

# Total Crypto Market:

The entire market has done much better than my Top Ten portfolio, +6% since January 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/r6pvnv9t593e1.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1a31e6afe5d7ca542ec4f01de4065e44815db44

# Bitcoin Dominance:

BitDom ended October at 59% and has slowly but steadily been rising since late 2022. Chart below:

https://preview.redd.it/h96cia8v593e1.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ad10273aab33d7ccd4b3adb3ed75efd0c4cb91f

For those just getting into crypto, it’s worth paying attention to the **Bitcoin** dominance figure, as it can signal appetite for altcoins vs. **BTC.**

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2022 Top Ten is one of seven concurrent experimental portfolios.  Where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): up +4% (total value $1,043)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +453% (total value $5,532)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +694% (total value $7,944) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +190% (total value $2,901)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): down -44% (total value $555) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +74% (total value $1,740)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-10): up +11% (total value $1,113)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,829**

**That’s up +198%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals:

https://preview.redd.it/vitj36vx593e1.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=474c35ac8625e2e62a3cb73c3dbe880bd1ac38dd

In summary: ***That’s a +198% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. 

https://preview.redd.it/qc88z4b0693e1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=da1780e68ac96fd418f34e41d7e5b3d353b3e684

The S&P 500 is up +20% since January 2022, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,200 had it been redirected to the S&P.  

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,143 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,286 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,774 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,525 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,202 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,492 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,201 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,624.**

That is up **+66%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+198%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

As the last section demonstrates, if you can stomach crypto’s volatility (a big if) over the past few years, you’ll find better overall returns in crypto vs. traditional markets – at least at this point in the Experiments.

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

cryptocurrency,Tectum Presents SoftNote at BRICS IFE Forum: The Future of Cross-Border Transactions,"October 2024 marks a critical moment as the expanded BRICS group addresses de-dollarisation at its summit in Kazan. With digital currency solutions at the forefront, Tectum took center stage at the International Finance and Economics BRICS Forum in Moscow, presenting its groundbreaking SoftNote product, which merges fiat and crypto for seamless everyday transactions.

“We’re building a new era for global transactions, where crypto can seamlessly cross borders and overcome hurdles like currency conversion and high fees.” – Alex Guseff, Founder of Tectum

The BRICS summit in Kazan marks the first meeting of the extended BRICS group since its extension earlier this year. Ever since the BRICS became more inclusive and shifted towards the Global South, including Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. As more states of the Global South are joining the BRICS, a dilemma about de-dollarisation is taking the top position on the agenda. As many experts suggest, the answer may lie in fintech innovations that combine the stability of hard-currency-backed digital assets with the flexibility of crypto. Solutions like SoftNote have the potential to seamlessly merge traditional and digital finance, enabling consumers and businesses to transact across borders with ease and minimal fees.

“Imagine a world where crypto is as fluid as the dollar, but for everyone. SoftNote is making that vision a reality.” – Alex Guseff, Founder of Tectum

While various states are looking to develop and implement new systems of digital transactions, the private sector intends to look for ready-to-go solutions. The International Finance and Economics BRICS Forum (IFE Forum) that took place in Moscow from 17th to the 22nd of October allowed businesses to present their solutions and develop inter-continental contacts across the BRICS member countries. Tectum’s team has been privileged to present their flagship product – SoftNote. SoftNote turns cryptocurrency into cash, enabling seamless crypto spending in everyday transactions. It makes using crypto as easy as traditional cash.

About Tectum

Tectum is a blockchain pioneer redefining global remittance and payment systems with its SoftNote solution. It offers a seamless, borderless platform for fiat and crypto transactions.

cryptocurrency,"What’s your take on the new emerging AI x Crypto crossover?
","AI agents are autonomous programs capable of multi-step decision-making without human intervention, making them significantly more advanced than traditional bots. Their ability to adapt and interact dynamically could change how automation is used in crypto.

The emergence of AI agents highlights new possibilities in the industry, such as using agents as personal assistants for tasks like scheduling or financial analysts for creating tailored strategies.  They can enhance efficiency by reducing human intervention in crypto-related activities like trading or governance.

The evolution from AI 1.0 to AI 2.0 reflects a shift from reactive to proactive capabilities, with these agents now able to take initiative and engage in complex tasks - aligning perfectly with the decentralized ethos of crypto. 

The rise of a ""multi-agent era"" in crypto would enable on-chain agents to interact seamlessly with protocols, smart contracts, and other AI systems. This could revolutionize DeFi, DAO operations, and decentralized marketplaces. Building the necessary infrastructure to enable these interactions will be a key area of focus in the coming years.

Current challenges include the accuracy of AI outputs, often referred to as ""hallucinations,"" and the lack of standardization across blockchain and web2 ecosystems. These issues highlight the work needed to scale AI agents to fully autonomous, reliable tools.

[**https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/11/42050388/high-stakes-and-higher-scandals-inside-wynn-resorts-legal-and-ethical-crisis**](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/11/42050388/high-stakes-and-higher-scandals-inside-wynn-resorts-legal-and-ethical-crisis)  


First things first: Steve Wynn, the company’s founder, was key to its brand and success, as they positioned it. But then, in January 2018, the Wall Street Journal revealed sexual misconduct allegations against him, backed by over 150 interviews.  
  
  
These allegations, some dating back decades, led to investigations by Nevada and Massachusetts regulators. Both found Wynn guilty and uncovered a cover-up by senior executives (what a shocker, right?). The result was a staggering $55M in fines for the company.  


After that, the market reaction was fast. $WYNN stock plunged 18% in just days, triggering a lawsuit from investors. They accused the company of hiding Wynn’s misconduct and exposing them to financial risk.  
  


Now, after years of legal battles, Wynn Resorts has agreed to pay a $70M settlement. So, if you owned shares during this time, you might be eligible to submit a claim.



While the company has taken steps to rebuild its reputation — like securing a UAE gaming license, reducing debt, and launching a $1B share buyback program — $WYNN still trades at $93, down 51% from its 2018 peak of $192.

stockmarket,Elon Musk made me invested 50k$ in Unusual Machines (UMAC). Here is why:,"Over the past year, I’ve been watching videos from the Ukraine battlefield, and one thing has become crystal clear: **drones are dominating modern warfare**. You don’t need to watch dozens of clips to understand that a $200 drone can accomplish what we used to rely on $100M fighter jets to do—without risking human lives or expensive equipment.

Why risk an F-35 in a mission to strike small infantry divisions when you can send coordinated, cost-effective drones and achieve the same results?

Elon Musk echoed this idea on Sunday, November 24, 2024, when he tweeted a video of 1,000 drones flying in perfect coordination, commenting:

*“Meanwhile, some idiots are still building manned fighter jets like the F-35.”*

As someone who shares this view, I was thrilled to see him bring attention to the reality of modern warfare. (You can check the tweet here: [https://twitter.com/x/migrate?tok=7b2265223a222f656c6f6e6d75736b2f7374617475732f31383630353734333737303133383338303333222c2274223a313733323732393633367d6d600678d43c70293525f4204e0e157d](https://twitter.com/x/migrate?tok=7b2265223a222f656c6f6e6d75736b2f7374617475732f31383630353734333737303133383338303333222c2274223a313733323732393633367d6d600678d43c70293525f4204e0e157d) )

This morning, another piece of news reinforced my belief in the future of drones. **Unusual Machines**, the only U.S.-based manufacturer of drone components, just hired Donald Trump Jr. as an adviser. His goal? To bring drone manufacturing back to America:  
[https://cnb.cx/3CQyRvK](https://cnb.cx/3CQyRvK)

By January 2026, federal law mandates that no government dollars can be spent on drones made outside the U.S. This will spark a $17 billion industry revival in just a few years.

Unusual Machines, with its $44 million market cap, is perfectly positioned to benefit. It’s the classic “shovel-and-bucket” play of this drone-driven narrative—a small company poised to dominate in an industry about to explode.

stockmarket,How are smaller companies having such a bad 1-2 years lately but big companies are booming?,"How are smaller companies in good fields taking such a hit over the last 1-2 years but big companies continue to boom?

I’m no expert but that just seems crazy and so inorganic. I get that the company’s themselves aren’t doing well or might have a bad financial year but down 90% or more in a year or two just doesn’t really make sense to me. 

For it to drop like that, it obviously means people are selling but in order for those sales to go through that means people are still buying the stock so somebody still believes in the company. 

And like they could have a bad year where revenue is down 25% or more than previous years, so how does that justify a 90% drop? Or maybe they’re running low on cash, and really the only way to raise cash to help their situation is issuing shares, or a reverse split or whatever. If cash on hand is their biggest problem, wouldn’t making the stock price go up help the company and then lead to more growth? Granted cash-on-hand is probably hardly the biggest factors in these drops but just trying to grow my knowledge. 

I thought the stock market kinda went hand-in-hand in a sense that when big companies are growing, the little ones also follow, kinda like in 2020-2021, now it seems to be the opposite

I guess is that just the difference between big companies and small ones? When hard times come, the big ones are able to adjust and recover and the smaller ones just get destroyed?

And to finish it off, how do you tell the difference between companies that have no hope and will most likely be bankrupt soon, versus those that will most likely make a comeback and recover from being down 90% or more. I feel like it could be a great time to put a little bit of money in these smaller companies but don’t really know how to tell if they’re gonna last or not

stockmarket,Huge Insider Buying at Prospect Capital $PSEC,"Prospect capital's share price took a big hit last month and it was due to an audio forcing them to take a loss on investments that will bring in revenue soon. This dividend stock is way undervalued. And the insider buying lately backs up that thesis.

The CEO has purchased nearly 4.2 million shares or over $20 million! he takes 0 Salary! The President has a salary of 175K and has purchase about that in shares! Every day this week I get SEC filings saying they are buying more. See for yourself:

[https://www.prospectstreet.com/investors/Docs/InsiderFilings/](https://www.prospectstreet.com/investors/Docs/InsiderFilings/)

Yesterday somebody I follow took a call from the company and told us this:

""The Chief Credit Officer at PSEC called me about 11am yesterday. Steven Stone. I was surprised it was from a cell phone. We spoke in February for about 50 mins as well. I have actually met the CEO 3x, last about 13 years ago at an annual shareholders meeting. I first attended in my 20s, was in the city. 1 thing you should know about PSEC is that it is a super defensive stock. The idea is, it is supposed to stay level, about 6, and supposed to give you near 12% in dividends, while having a steady price… We can see that has happened in this market, but that is the idea. It is always good to diversify… I had called and thought the drop off was do to their main REIT business. That business has about 70 multi family properties. Some with 100s of units. Those properties are not prime areas, they are 2^(nd)/3^(rd) tier.. They cash flow well, but on paper, they can depreciate, the asset value, prime can depreciate a lot! So this quarter the value of the REITS were written down much harder than the past, this is determined by their auditor… Every quarter there 117 investments must be appraised…. The loss and bad quarter is on 3 companies. 1 of which they finally did take a write off of near 120 million! PGX a credit repair service. The original owners took out nearly 200 million loan. When they could no longer pay the loan back, as the Govt fined and halted the business, they could not pay it… So PSEC took it over. It has a lot of upside, the margins there are high. We had spoke about this in February and had hoped that the service would be up and running. But it is still shut down, so the auditor forced them to take the loss… This is on paper! They didn’t lose the cash, the cash was loaned out. Hence the EPS will look bad.. They did earn less income because the other 2 of 3 that messed this quarter up, are failing. PSEC suspended interest payments on these 2. 1 of these holds a 180 million loan. PSEC cut the dividend and has chosen to take over these 2 businesses for a turn around. When turned they may sell the business and reap rewards.. Personally, hearing about these other 2, EH! But the credit repair is a cash cow.""

Recently, I have decided to move to long term positions and I have been very bullish on space stocks like LUNR and RKLB. I genuinely feel like space will be the fastest growing sector over the next decade. Anyway, I went home that night, watched a few videos on some cool stuff in quantum computing and said screw it, I think I’m long on quantum computing.

Apparently, I just had amazing timing because this past week has apparently been great for quantum. Researchers have figured out an important milestone in controlling qubits and Amazon announced that they were investing $4B into their own quantum computer. D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) cracked a standardized encryption on a binary computer a few days ago too. There’s been some big steps in the right direction on quantum lately.

stockmarket,Energy Fuels $UUUU DD,"**Overview**

Energy Fuels, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the extraction, recovery, recycling, exploration, permitting, evaluation, and sale of uranium mineral properties in the United States. The company produces and sells vanadium pentoxide, rare earth elements, and heavy mineral sands such as ilmenite, rutile, zircon, and monazite.

**Explanation of Element and Mineral Importance**

**Uranium –** This is the fuel for nuclear reactors. Please see my post on Uranium if you want to understand the significance of it, and why Energy Fuels will massively benefit from it. Link Here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g51fj0/get\_in\_on\_uranium\_now/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g51fj0/get_in_on_uranium_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

 

**Vanadium** is a key component in vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), which are used for energy storage systems. Due to shifts toward renewable energy sources, the demand for efficient, large-scale energy storage is increasing. VRFBs are particularly suited for grid storage due to their scalability, long lifespan, and ability to discharge over a long period, making vanadium an essential material for the emerging clean energy economy. This shift represents a significant growth driver for the vanadium market as energy storage technologies become increasingly vital.

https://preview.redd.it/8jf3r5ebv93e1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9db23e3e0e6bc655f2972abc967ae3283ac808e

**SWOT on VRFBs (Guidehouse Insights)**

The nuclear energy sector represents a significant opportunity for vanadium products. Vanadium alloys are highly valuable due to their low neutron-absorption characteristics and high temperature and corrosion resistance. These properties make vanadium-based alloys ideal for use in nuclear reactors, particularly in the construction of pressure vessels and structural components. The ability of vanadium alloys to withstand the harsh operating environments inside a nuclear reactor without significant degradation, extends the service life of these components, enhancing the overall safety and efficiency of nuclear power plants.

Vanadium is also used in the aerospace industry and plays a huge role in the steel industry as well, due to its ability to enhance the strength and durability of steel.

**Rare Earth Elements (REE’s)**

**NdPr –** A combination of two rare earth elements: Neodymium (Nd) and Praseodymium (Pr). These elements are both crucial in the production of high-strength permanent magnets. Their powerful magnetic properties are essential in: Electric vehicles, wind turbines, consumer electronics, and defense technologies. Energy Fuels is one of the few US companies able to commercialize the production of separated NdPr.

**Growth Projection for REEs in Energy Transition (Source: Adamas Intelligence)**

 

**NdFeB Magnets and Why They Are Important**

Neodymium-Iron-Boron Magnets are a type of permanent magnet. They are the strongest commercially available magnet offering high magnetic strength while being lightweight and compact. With the energy transition going on, demand for these magnets is increasing significantly YoY.

**NdFeB Magnet Content**

As we can see in the chart, NdPr accounts for about a third of NdFeB magnets composition.

**Heavy Mineral Sands**

**Ilmenite –** Mined and processed to produce titanium oxide (TiO2). TiO2 is used in paints, coatings, and plastics which allows UUUU to diversify their revenue further into industrial areas.

**Zircon –** Used for manufacturing ceramics, refractory materials, and foundry molds. Also used in the medical industry for things like dental and orthopedic implants, and for PET imaging which is used for cancer diagnostics.

**Rutile –** Similar to ilmenite, rutile has a superior quality of titanium content making it more valuable.

**Monazite –** A rare mineral that contains rare-earth elements and uranium. Used as a feedstock by Energy Fuels in their processing endeavors. NdPr is extracted from Monazite as well as the minerals mentioned above.

https://preview.redd.it/s4y482vev93e1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=29e6c68d972ac33b6d0b22506f6c5168fb1f924a

**White Mesa Mill**

·         100% owned by Energy Fuels, is the only facility in the USA able to process Monazite to produce REE’s.

·         The only fully licensed and operating conventional uranium mill in the US.

·         Completed “Phase 1” REE facility with up to 1,000 tonnes of separated NdPr production capacity.

·         Largest producer of Vanadium in the US. (Production on standby currently due to low prices, strong inventory on hand.

Average revenue growth for the last 3 years has been 196%.

The negative EBITDA is not something to worry about. Mining sites are not easy to develop and require a lot of funding. Although, once these mines are up and running, heavy mineral sands mining is low cost. They are continuing to focus on creating revenue generating assets. The company has essentially zero debt and very few liabilities, with assets that doubled from 2020 to 2023. In the next year, I believe we will see positive EBITDA due to mines becoming operational, instead of sitting idle.

**Q3 2024 Highlights**

·         Very good balance sheet with over $180 million of liquidity and no debt.

·         Uranium prices continue to drive revenue. Sold 50,000 pounds of U3O8 at spot price of $80. Proceeds totaling $4 million, gross profit margin of 54%.

·         New long-term uranium contract. Expected delivery of 270,000-330,000 pounds between 2026 and 2027.

·         Produced 38 tonnes of separated NdPr at White Mesa Mill.

·         NdPr produced at White Mesa is currently being qualified with permanent magnet manufactures and other potential customers, setting the stage for growth.

·         Strong uranium inventory consisting of 235,000 pounds finished U3O8. 805,000 pounds of U3O8 in ore and raw materials. Expects inventory to continue increasing due to mining operations.

·         A large vanadium inventory of 905,000 pounds finished V2O5.

**Acquisition of RadTran LLC**

On August 19^(th), 2024, Energy Fuels announced it acquired RadTran, a private company specializing in the separation of critical radioisotopes. Since 2021, Energy Fuels and RadTran have been working together to evaluate the feasibility of recovering radium-226 and radium-228 from uranium processing at White Mesa Mill. These recovered isotopes would be made available to the pharmaceutical industry and others to enable the production of acintium-225 and lead-212. These isotopes are critical components in the development of targeted alpha therapies which offer promising new treatments for various cancers. There is currently a global shortage of Ra-226 and Ra-228, therefore limiting the supply of Ac-225 and Pb-212. This is a huge acquisition for Energy Fuels as medical isotopes possess immense demand.

**Acquisition of Base Resources**

On October 2^(nd), 2024, Energy Fuels announced the completion of its acquisition of Base Resources. This is expected to transform the company into a global leader in critical mineral production, including titanium, zirconium, REEs, and uranium. This is huge for the company as they brought in world class management and operations capability while gaining ownership over the Toliara Project in Madagascar. This is widely considered by industry experts to be one of the best HMS (heavy mineral sands) projects in the world.

**Conclusion**

I think this is a company with massive potential to be a large player in the supply chain for Vanadium and REEs. With a stockpile of 905,000 pounds of V2O5, they are easily able to capitalize on growing demand. They are also in a great position to capitalize on the growing domestic market for uranium, as we continuously rely less on foreign nations. With 235,000 pounds of inventory on hand and a production capability of 1.1-1.4 million pounds of U3O8 per year, the company will be able to profit from further spot sales and long-term contracts. With strategic acquisitions of Base Resources and RadTran, the company clearly demonstrates commitment to growth and innovation. At a current price of **$6.90**, I believe within 2 years this company will triple in price to around **$20**.",7,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1h0fvp9/energy_fuels_uuuu_dd/

I have recently started diving into world indices and looking more closely at the trends in global markets. One thing that caught my attention was the significant sell-off in early August 2023 that affected major indices across the globe.

From what I have gathered, there were a number of factors at play, but I am curious to hear your thoughts on what really drove the market downturn. Was it mostly due to economic data (like inflation), bond yields, geopolitical tensions, or something else?

I have been reading about the impact of U.S. inflation, rising bond yields, and concerns over China’s economic slowdown, but I would love to hear from others who have more experience with this. What do you think caused this major sell-off, and how did it affect different global indices?

Looking forward to hearing your insights!",0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1h0pc1f/what_caused_the_major_sell_down_across_major/
stockmarket,Weatherford International Stock (NASDAQ: WFRD) : oilfield services company with 60% upside potential.,"What's the idea? After taking office in January 2025, new US President Donald Trump, a supporter of conventional energy, may introduce measures to support the industry, which could increase demand for the services of oilfield services companies such as Weatherford. The possible measures include: revising Joe Biden's offshore oil and gas permitting plan and radically increase the number of new drilling auctions; lifting the moratorium on liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from new projects; redirecting budget incentives from renewable energy projects to hydrogen production and carbon capture and storage projects; imposing tariffs on US oil imports.

• **Expansion:** Shopify is gaining ground in new markets and industries.

• **Innovation:** Investments in AI and data centers are boosting its capabilities.

Here's my guess about this index. Please correct it.

1, There is a significant correlation between .DJSOEP and oil price.

[.DJSOEP](https://preview.redd.it/e2lfuvquw73e1.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e605a6f93689eb21b6b4ef6e470867765306ba6)

2, Oil mining output declines, Oil prices rise, oil companies' profits increase, company stock prices rise, and the index rises. The less oil mining, the higher this index is, explaining why it performs better under Biden administration.

3, Trump is preparing to increase oil drilling, plus with the OPEC preparing to increase production, and with the wars in the Middle East coming to an end, oil prices will decline after 2025, so this index will also remain low after 2025.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1h08g70/whats_the_logic_behind_djsoep_dow_jones_us_select/

stockmarket,Opening an account other than 401k?,"

Hi everyone,

I started my career a few months ago and have been fortunate enough to have some expendable income. I’m currently contributing about $1,000 per month to my company’s 401k. My portfolio is allocated as follows: 60% in an S&P 500 index fund, 25% in a blue chip growth fund, and 15% in a 2065 target date fund. Originally, all my contributions were going to the 2065 fund, but I shifted to a more aggressive strategy since I'm only 23.

I'm considering opening another account to invest in individual stocks, as I'm somewhat limited in my current 401k options. I can afford an additional $500 per month for this. However, I'm also debating whether it would be better to just increase my 401k contributions, considering the tax advantages.

What do you all think? Should I diversify with individual stocks, or focus on maximizing my 401k?

2. Don’t pick shit stocks stick with the best names.
3. Don’t play options, ever.
4. Diversify. Everyone and their own way of doing this. Find which way works best for you.  
5. Don’t think about getting rich overnight, it takes years of DCA and scaling into a bigger portfolio and also where you will see best results(5-10+ years)
6. Always focus on maxing Roth IRA before brokerage. 
7. Why settle for the 2nd best when you can buy the best?(example; NVDA consistently outperformed AMD)
8. You should have less than 30(I have less than 10) stocks overall. You don’t want 300 stocks worth a few dollars, when you can have 10 or 30 worth a few thousand.

As a digital native I've worked a lot with Google's products and I've used google like everyone else to an extent where it is part of my everyday life. But now... Not so much. I have to admit - I'm finding myself searching very rarely. Yeah, I'm using maps and gmail and so on - but the moat on those businesses is not very high. My gut - as their core consumer - is telling me that I don't need google as much as I used to. And honestly, for the first time every where I've actively reflected on it - I totally can imagine a world without google.

So, I'm not so sure we are going back to an all dominant Google again, and instead of assuming that Google will be the mastodont forever, I can more rationally imagine a scenario where the business slowly adapts into niches over time. Think Kodak etc.

Nope. Not even close.

You're only allowed 4 indicators total and 6 overlays. 6 overlays are a bit much, however, 4 indicators doesn't do it justice. For me, I like to have the following indicators giving me information: TTM, W/R, AROON, CCI, & EFI.

W/R doesn't exist on Legend, nor does TTM, W/E, or EFI... bummer.

Additionally, I only use Pivot Points & 4 SMAs (10, 20, 50, & 200).

stockmarket,"An unusual problem: All the stocks I bought this year went instantly up, and I'm disappointed because I kept a lot of cash waiting for corrections, none of which happened. Now they are all expensive to me, I am stuck holding 50% in cash. I hate DCA.","All stocks are bought this year, since I started investing this year.

I bought Disney two months ago, practically at the bottom, for $90, expecting 25-30% growth in around a year, but now it's already at $115.

I bought United Airlines for $51 four months ago, practically right before the spike, now it's $90. At the same time bought Delta Airlines for 45$, now is 64$, but sold at 54$.

I bought Archer in May, at the bottom, for $3.20 now it's at $6.0. Even before the spike, I sold 70% of Archer shares, expecting to buy them for less later. Five days after the sale, they doubled. Bought Joby at the same time for 5.7, now is 7.1. I am convinced of the long-term success of these two companies.

Bought QQQ in March, now is 15% up and expensive. Planed to buy in November last year, but did not have the money. The most of the portfolio.

And now comes the most important thing, because of which I got pissed off:

In August bought RKLB at 5.7. Now: 23. And bought LUNR at 5.2, now: 14.

I was extremely convinced of the long-term success of RKLB and LUNR before I even heard there was a WSB subreddit and before I even heard they were popular stocks. That was my internal research unrelated to stock market trends. My plan was to buy them for long-term holding, at least 10 years. RKLB was my main planned investment. For LUNR, I wasn't so sure about the long-term success, but I certainly was for the short-term. I was 100% sure about RKLB. I wanted the best possible entry position. Bought RKLB for 5.7 and LUNR for 5.2. However, I only invested small percent of the planned sum, because I wanted to continue buying for less. I waited, waited, expecting some kind of correction, but after I bought them, they immediately went parabolic, and I was getting more and more angry and didn't want to buy until they fell significantly. They did not fall, but only went up. I even sold 30% of RKLB and LUNR at $11 and $8.1, expecting a correction so I could buy more shares for less. So I reduced the number of shares even more. Five days after the sale, this biggest spike followed. From 11 to 22, and from 8 to 14. While others can't wait to see their shares grow, I was pissed off with every movement up, because I was losing the chance to buy them at a lower price, and I certainly expected that success, just not this fast. Now I'm left with 50% of my money in cash, and only a total of 4% of my portfolio in RKLB and LUNR. So:

RKLB, LUNR, ACHR and Joby are for long term (QQQ included). The rest: until they recover.

The rest of portfolio (all bought last week) is: ASML, bought last week at 621e. (3% of portfolio), PDD Holdings and Baidu, bought couple days ago at 105$ and 82$ (total of 3.5% of portfolio). Also Google, bougt two days ago at 168$. I am planing Nike and Alibaba next days.

Also bought Planet Labs in August at the bootom for 2.1, now is 3.5. Sold at 2.3 because I was not sure in long-term success. Ten days after the sale went double.

Someone would say that I did very well, but I am extremely dissatisfied because the most important planned investments (RKLB, and then ACHR) got away from me, i.e. I only have 3 percent of the total portfolio in them, and only 6% in RKLB, ACHR, LUNR and Joby, which were my main long term targets.

Called earlier and was told that when you use Cash app to fund your account it’s “hit or miss” on whether it works or not and that they had no control over that so there wasn’t anything they could do on their end. They also mentioned something about Mastercard being the ones who were in control of the transaction and were the ones who decided if it was went through or not which didn’t make much sense to me.

stockmarket,I’ve been covering $NVDA since 2011 when it was worth just $0.35 per share (post-split adjusted that is). AMA about its latest earnings report. ,"**Update: Looks like we ran into sitewide issue right when things got started, I'll be back at noon ET to try this again!**   
  
Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022.

I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since.

Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with [the threat of increased competition](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-rivals-are-circling-but-theyre-still-years-from-catching-up-211621835.html) to [attending the company’s GTC conference](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-debuts-next-generation-blackwell-ai-chip-at-gtc-2024-205825161.html) to chatting with [CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/demand-is-just-so-strong-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-tells-yahoo-finance-supply-cant-keep-up-012653951.html).

With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like [AMD are gaining steam](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-debuts-latest-ai-chips-as-it-battles-rivals-nvidia-intel-180032426.html), and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant.

How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess.

In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips.

💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs  $33.2B expected  
💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected  
💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected

Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion.

I’ll be back tomorrow, Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. ET to answer your questions about Nvidia’s latest earnings, the market reaction, and where the stock goes from here.

stockmarket,"Doubt about [The Intelligent Investor]: Could this be an error?
","Chapter 2: The Investor and Inflation

\- Inflation and corporate earnings. (p. 51-52)

....""Our extended studies have led to the conclusion that the investor cannot count on much above the recent five-year rate earned on the DJIA group— about 10% on net tangible assets (book value) behind the shares. Since the market value of these issues is well above their book value—say, 900 market vs. 560 book in mid-1971—the earnings on current market price work out only at some 61⁄4%. (This relationship is generally expressed in the reverse, or “times earnings,” manner—e.g., that the DJIA price of 900 equals 18 times the actual earnings for the 12 months ended June 1971.)...""

It states that the market value of the stocks was 900, with an earnings yield of 6.25% (EPS = 56.25). Later, it mentions that this corresponds to a P/E ratio of 18 (""the DJIA price of 900 is equal to 18 times the actual earnings"").

However, when I calculate the P/E ratio, I get 16:

\\\[

\\text{P/E} = \\frac{\\text{Market Price}}{\\text{EPS}} = \\frac{900}{56.25} = 16

\\\]

So, I’m wondering:

1. Could the stated \*\*18\*\* in the book be an approximation or a rounded figure?
2. Or is there some other context or implicit calculation that justifies the value of 18?

stockmarket,Results after Investing for three months so far. ,"How am I doing so far? Any criticism or advice will greatly be appreciated! 

I’m looking to buy some growth and extra dividends!
Pharma, more AI stocks, Semiconductors, beauty products, bevs, SCMI on watchlist, and Nike stocks. 

I’m also a holder of SCHD, VOO, SCHG, SCHX, MSTY, CONY, SPYI, JEPQ, CVX, CVS, VICI, and Palantir are my majority holdings! 

Portfolio: 60-80% dividend stocks and 20-40% growth stocks.

My strategy is to sell high on my growth stocks and then reinvested into my dividends stocks. New funds going in monthly or biweekly will be out into stocks that are low and buy now! Then rinse, wash, and repeat. Is there anything I should be concerned about? 

After I get done paying off my student loans. All of those extra income will be going towards my savings and more funding! Any recommendations for 2025 will be appreciated! 

Thanks! 😊

They were trading almost 90 pps pre conservatorship then dropped to .20, now they’re up to 3.42 since the end of the election. I own 200k shares. So I’m invested financially and emotionally.

Using Fidelity/RobinHood here’s my plan:

Dividend Stocks (50%): For consistent income.

ETFs: Considering ETFs like Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM) or iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) for diversified exposure.

Individual Stocks: Companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Procter & Gamble (PG), or Coca-Cola (KO) are known for reliable dividends.

Growth Stocks (30%): For high growth potential.

Technology (e.g., Apple, NVIDIA, Microsoft) or healthcare innovation.

ETFs: Growth-focused ETFs like ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) or Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) provide diversified growth exposure.

stockmarket,How to Hedge Against Inflation: Thoughts on the Incoming Administration,"I’ve been thinking a lot about the incoming administration’s potential impact on inflation and the economy. Many of Trump’s proposed policies strike me as inherently inflationary. Here are some key points I’ve been considering:

1. **Mass Deportation:**
   * Disrupting this workforce will almost certainly induce inflation by increasing labor shortages and raising wages in certain sectors.
2. **Tariffs:**
   * Tariffs are another concern. Even if Trump walks back some of his campaign promises, tariffs are still inflationary.
3. **Cutting Government Jobs/Spending:**
   * This is sure to create economic strain.

**The Big Question:** Given these potential policies, where should I position myself in an inflationary environment???

* **Equities:**
   * Equities are often considered a hedge against inflation because companies can pass costs on to consumers. Housing also tends to be a good hedge, as property values often keep pace with inflation. However, at what point does sustained inflation trigger an **economic crash** or a sharp market sell-off?
* **Cash:**
   * Cash seems like a losing proposition during inflationary times, as its purchasing power erodes. But could there be a moment when the market correction makes holding cash advantageous? Warren Buffet seems to think so.
* **Tech Stocks:**
   * Imo tech stocks, particularly B2B companies, might be less impacted by these inflationary pressures. They’re less reliant on cheap labor and less vulnerable to tariffs. If there’s a broad market sell-off, I’d expect the S&P to take a hit initially, but I think tech might see breakouts later as inflationary impacts stabilize.

So, what do you all think? Where would you position yourself? Are there other sectors or strategies I’m overlooking? Stealman my argument.",49,166,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1guc0az/how_to_hedge_against_inflation_thoughts_on_the/

It shows strong momentum to the upside but still we have to do our due diligence before opening new positions. My indicators on chart are as follows: Green cloud is 200 sma, Brown cloud is 50ema and the other two moving averages I have are 9/21 ema. If the price is above all the moving averages, that shows strong momentum to the up. On the bottom I have EPS (Earnings Per Share) and GPE - Price/Earnings to Growth which is also called PEG ratio. A lower PEG ratio indicates the stock is *undervalued.* An undervalued stock with high EPS ratio is good for long term hold.

----------------

> Q: An S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100 index fund?

A: No, those are not sufficiently diversified, as they only hold US large cap stocks.

> Q: A total US stock index fund?

A: No, that's not sufficiently diversified, as it only holds US stocks.

> Q: A total world stock index fund?

A: Maybe, if you're just starting out; just be sure to have a plan to add bonds later.

> Q: A total world stock index fund along with a US or global bond fund?

A: Yes, that's a great option; start with a stock/bond ratio fitting your need/ability to take risk.

> Q: A 'target date' retirement fund?

A: Yes, in tax-advantaged accounts, that's often the simplest, one-stop, highly diversified, set-and-forget solution.

bogleheads,I Have Finished Reading The Psychology Of Money,"I just finished reading the psychology of money by Morgan Housel a few months after I started cause I’ve been busy. However, having read the common sense book of investing by Bogle before this, I really like how they pair. To me, Bogle’s book is about why you should invest in low cost index funds rationally but Housel’s book is about how to view money in general as he says: “…doing well with money has little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave”


These are main point Housel outlines as a summary of the book in the penultimate chapter:
- Go out of your way to find humility when things are going right and forgiveness/compassion when they go wrong.
- Less ego, more wealth.
- Manage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night.
- If you want to do better as an investor, the single most powerful thing you can do is increase your time horizon.
- Become ok with a lot of things going wrong. You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune.
- Use money to gain control over your time.
- Be nicer and less flashy.
- Save. Just save. You don’t need a specific reason to save.
- Define the cost of success and be ready to pay it.
- Avoid the extreme ends of financial decisions.
- You should like risk because it pays off over time (but you should be paranoid of ruinous risk).
- Define the game you’re playing (eg long term investing, day trading etc).
- Respect the mess. There is no single right answer.

bogleheads,"Parent died, how to invest life insurance and other money","My father in law died last week after an illness, leaving behind his wife of 70. I've been tapped with the responsibility of working through the finances to get her through the finances. Here's the numbers and some assumptions I have (correct me if my understanding is wrong on anything).

* Between my father in law's SS and a pension, she will receive about $35K in income. 
* Life insurance proceeds of $40K.
* There's an IRA she's inherited worth about $56K which she has to deplete within 10 years.
* An annuity with a cash value of $45K.
* Fully paid for house worth about $300K (no interest in moving, it was bought with the intention of her living there alone after his passing).
* Fully paid for car that should last her until she's asked to stop driving and she has no interest in getting a different one.
* Annual expenses less health care is \~$25K
* Health care is fairly minimal for a 70 year old and is less than $5k/year.
* She also has a whole life policy she pays $270/year for a $10K benefit that she has paid on since 1995 (she worked for a whole life company at one time and really loves the product and I have steered clear of that conversation because my opinion wasn't asked).
* Cash on hand is good for about 4 months of expenses

All of the family, 3 children between 45 and 50 years old are well taken care of middle to upper class and have no need of any inheritance or proceeds. If push comes to shove at some point, the mother in law can live with one of the kids in the DFW, KC or Norfolk, VA metro areas.

My question is can my mother in law become a Boglehead and do the 3 fund (or 2 fund, the international fund is going to be a tough sell or should I put the IRA, life insurance and annuity proceeds in some other fund sector? 

* I was going to put the inherited IRA into an account with VTI and BND (50/50) and 
* the $100k in cash (proceeds from annuity and life insurance in VTI since, ideally, it wouldn't be needed to drawn from for 10 years. 

Also, my mother in law has a real aversion to paying taxes, so anything to minimize that is welcome. Is this too aggressive for this case? I'm looking for specific sectors of ETF's.

Kinda wish there was a legend for the colors in the second pic but I think the blue one was the desert portfolio? And it was an even smoother ride than the permanent portfolio?

a) One argument in favor of the desert portfolio he mentions is its simplicity (3 funds). But I somehow think that simplicity doesn't really matter anymore if we can just get M1 finance pies and if other brokerages start offering pies though? Unless we are really DIYing it in fidelity or something

b) Are there not portfolios that have an even smoother climb to the top than one with just 3 funds inside?

c) If you are young in your 20s-30s like him, what is the function of something like the  desert portfolio? To use as a riskier version of a HYSA to save for something like 10-15 years later?

d) In your opinion, for a young person just stacking VOO or VT, is something like the desert portfolio something you would use to gradually transition into as you get closer to retirement? Ex: reach age 50, start selling off VT for m1 finance desert portfolio pies? Ex: sell X percent of your VOO, write down with a crayon how much money it sold for, login to M1 finance, buy that amount of pie? Better to back out info GOVT? Better to back out into BNDW?

I am thinking probably not, because the mutual fund value will likely decrease by the amount of distribution, the day after the ex-dividend date. Thus, while I missed the actual distribution, my share values were slightly higher than they would be after the distribution.

Below is a list of the available funds and their tickers and net expense ratios. I would appreciate some insight on whether I should put 100% in on my Target Date/Retirement Fund or do a 3-fund split per what I've learned from reading a bit of the Wiki (3-fund and approximating total stock market). 

Stocks/Blends:

* Fidelity Mid Cap Index	FSMDX	0.03%
* Fidelity Small Cap Index	FSSNX	0.03%
* iShares MSCI EAFE International Index K	BTMKX	0.05%
* State Street Equity 500 Index K	SSSYX	0.02%
* State Street Global All Cap Equity Ex-Us Index K	SSGLX	0.07%
* State Street Target Retirement 2055 K	SSDQX	0.09%
* State Street Target Retirement 2060 K	SSDYX	0.09%
* State Street Target Retirement K	SSFOX	0.09%
* Vanguard Balanced Index Adml	VBIAX	0.07%
* Vanguard Growth Index Adml	VIGAX	0.05%
* Vanguard Small Cap Growth Index Adml	VSGAX	0.07%
* Vanguard Small Cap Index Adml	VSMAX	0.05%
* Vanguard Small Cap Value Index Admiral	VSIAX	0.07%
* Vanguard Value Index Adml	VVIAX	0.05%

Bonds:

* State Street Aggregate Bond Index K	SSFEX	0.03%

---
Based on the insight learned from reading, I either should do something like:

- 100% on SSDQX/SSDYX 

or

- [56% SSSYX, 14% FSSNX]* to cover large and small-cap US market, 20% SSGLX to cover INTL market, and 10% bonds.

(*edited after reading comments!)

Would something like the latter make sense? The latter minimizes some degree of fees/expenses,  as opposed to the convenience of all-in on the TDF. 

Either way, any insight would be greatly appreciated, as I am only beginning to learn nuances of long-term investing.

bogleheads,Helping 75 year old family member with their portfolio with income covering expenses?,"Looking to help a family member who’s 75 with their investment portfolio. They thankfully have enough income to cover their expenses without dipping into their portfolio for withdrawals. So I was wondering if this would change their recommended risk / allocation. 

The total portfolio is $250K but only invested in individual stocks. Thankfully (really more so luckily) the stocks have done well over the last decade. Think stocks like Amazon, Apple, etc. They also have $50K in a high yield savings account (Marcus). 

It’s currently divided across 6 stocks but with a large overweighted amount in Apple (over 50% of portfolio). 

I’d like to obviously get them out of individual stocks, and into indexes. 

I’d look at total profit long term cap gains for all (long holds) and sell in a way with the least amount of unrealized gains, so they don’t get slammed at tax time. 

I was thinking since they don’t need to live off the portfolio, at least 50% in stocks might be ok? For example maybe 50% stocks, 30% bonds, and 20% cash in high yield? 

They still want some of their individual shares, so ideally I’d make it less than 5% of portfolio and 45% in an index like VOO, etc. 

Anyone have any fund of funds that would be ideal for this? Maybe something like a balanced fund, VBIAX, keep a tiny smidge (to keep them happy psychologically) of the individual stocks, and the rest in Marcus / Ally or similar? 

They love all the big gains, but obviously tons of unnecessary risk for someone in their 70s. 

Thanks in advance for any help. Happy to share exact numbers but basically $250K in a couple of tech stocks, $20K in a high yield savings, and income is currently / always covered at current expense level (not tapping into investments).

30-yo EU-based starting ETF-investor here. After spending time on this subreddit several years ago, I decided to invest nearly all my savings in real estate (my own home) so ETFs became less relevant.

Situation now, I've built up some savings. I've been learning a lot from you all, browsing the subreddit the past few months and have decided to start investing. Partly due to FOMO, mostly due to not wanting to leave cash idle in my savings account.

I have some cash set aside which I'm not investing, depending on my personal situation. Total savings I'm willing to invest is 50k, which I reckon I won't need to touch for at least 5 years. I'm very prepared to accept a 2022-style 20% dip (2020-style 33% dip seems less likely, but who knows).

I'm planning to invest 80% in VOO lump-sum and investing the remaining 20% in other ETFs, maybe diversify geographically and/or sectorally, depending on what I fancy. Putting the remaining 20% in VOO is also an option. I could elaborate on how I arrived on that portfolio, if anyone is especially curious :).

I’m thinking of advising my son to sell the VTSMX and move the cash to a 529 in his name.

bogleheads,Inflation when investing for life in the S&P 500,"I'm pretty new to investing in general, and after a bit of back and forth I've come to realize that the best choice for me might be, like many others, to invest in an index fund or ETF of the S&P 500 with monthly contributions indefinitely (among other things).

I have a thought, however, which I can't seem to find a reliable answer to which is why I'm asking here. If contributing with, say, $100 each month, I would because of inflation be contributing less and less value of money over time. How do I adjust for this? Naturally, I'd have to invest more dollars per month according to inflation, but how exactly do I calculate what to put in every month? 

Since inflation is a percentage of the rate of change of value, would it be correct to, at 2% inflation, multiply 1.02 with 100 to get 102, and then the next month multiply 1.02 again with 102 and so on? Or should the calculation be made annually? Or am I just completely wrong and need to do something different? 

As probably evident I am very new to all of this but I'm eager to learn more and I feel like this is a pretty significant issue which needs to be understood by me if I am to maximize my potential growth.

I would like to describe my financial state and get your opinion on actual advice that helped you succeed financially. 

Me (M26) and my partner (M27) have been together for just over 10 years. We both own our own businesses (both successful for being only a few years old but we’re only pulling $95,000 / $125,000 a year right now). We have 12% equity in a home (just bought it on sought after development land) in a city that real estate typically does really well. 

I’m our jobs we both have the ability to make high bonuses (200,000 - 300,000 total yearly). I would say that that would happen 75% of the time. Obviously this would be amazing and we hope our hard work will be paying off like this in 2025. 

We don’t want kids. We have a cat. We aren’t that risk adverse. We don’t care much about fancy things and spend more of our time outdoors. We probably need $60,000 each a year to live very  comfortably (once we are no longer working). 

We would like to feel very financially free by about 35. I met with a financial planner who recommended stocks. Upon talking to some friends we realized building up your savings (they were diminished by the house buy), and protecting padding for yourself to take risks is a better bet than investing in stocks. Basically you can get more gains on your ability to produce wealth than in the stocks. Plus, we don’t have confidence in the stocks.

bogleheads,Vanguard's treatment of non resident aliens,"Wanted to raise the awareness eveywhere. As many places as possible. I'll be the bad guy. 

Vanguard US is making life painful for non resident aliens (NRA). Long standing customers for 25+ years. Treating us like pariah. No clarity on what is going to happen to our accounts. 

(1) ""Legacy"" mutual fund accounts platform is going to be retired. ""Everyone"" is going to be moved to Brokerage account. (2) But, NRAs are not eligible for Brokerage account. (3) Letter sent out to NRAs at various times saying we can keep the accounts only for redemptions, transfers, no more purchases : That in itself sounds ok, but will we continue to have online access to the ""Legacy"" mutual fund platform ? If they are going to retire the platform , obviously they will pull the plug on the IT systems as well. After that what do we unfortunate NRAs do ? Send paper mail, travel to US by ship ? 

The lack of clarity from top management is disappointing. Issue raised on Twitter - copying Washington Post columnist Michelle Singletary, Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Zweig, Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg columnist and author of The Bogle Effect. Dinah Wisenberg Brin has also been tweeted. 

I reached out to Managing Director, Head of Vanguard Personal Investor on Linked In. I got a call from an executive assistant. She tried her best but she also does not have clarity on what will happen post 2025. I cant blame her. 

Its like this : In an airline boarding gate, they announce : ""Everyone board the plane, except those wearing green shirts"". The plane takes off. Then they announce : ""You cannot wait at the gate if you have no flight to catch. We are gonna close the gate soon."" This is another way of asking green shirts to leave the airport or make alternate arrangements. 

I would rather Vanguard just send us a mail saying ""as a non resident alien you cannot continue with Vanguard. Please leave soon"". The honesty would be so refreshing.

I’m moving out in the next month or so, and she’ll likely be able to find a smaller place, and spend less…etc so maybe that changes. She has about 4K of saved money that she’d like to do something with it. I’m still getting into this thing so admittedly not the most knowledgeable, figured I’d come here to see what the Bogleheads suggest. I don’t expect full on financial advice, but any general suggestions are extremely appreciated. Thanks!",9,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1h0rs0z/investing_at_60/

I was well aware of the need for a tiny bit of “play money” to scratch the market interest / urge to meddle, so have a very small amount in trading212 (UK based) just to play about. I also put a small amount in UK premium bonds to satisfy the “maybe I’ll win big” hopes and keep me on-strategy in the main accounts. 

Premium bonds are utterly terrible from a rational perspective so I’m going to fold into my other investments. The T212 account is just mucking about time-wasting but seems to scratch the itch.

bogleheads,Transferring to Vanguard from financial advisor- fee problem,"

I recently decided to manage all my investments myself. I was mostly doing this already, but had a small Roth IRA account with a financial advisor with $7,400 in investments. I wanted to move the funds so I could invest in low fee funds with Vanguard. Last year I had asked my planner to buy total stock market funds rather than other mutual funds. When I accessed my account today and viewed the funds transferred, I noticed I had money spread across 17 funds (14 non Vanguard).  Selling Non vanguard funds incurs a $20 fee.

Most of the investments transferred were in fidelity 500 index, followed by fidelity mid cap index and then fidelity international index(60% of my money). Another 8% was in fidelity small cap US and international funds, and a smaller amount was in a few Vanguard funds which don’t charge a fee for me to sell. The remaining 28% is spread across 10 funds with very low dollar amounts).

I’m pretty disappointed that I either have to incur $340 in fees to get out of all these funds, or leave them in with less than average return. Not sure what to do here. I’m thinking I should keep the fidelity total market funds since that’s the same as Vanguard, but not sure what to do about the rest. I wanted a simple portfolio and it’s either take major losses in the form of fees, or keep as is. What would you advise?

bogleheads,The insurance industry has started its attack on the 4% rule,"[Rethinking the 4% rule](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/25/business/retirement-4-percent-rule/index.html)

I guess it was bound to happen eventually.  New ""research"" by the American Enterprise Institute, helpfully underwritten by the American Council for Life Insurers, has ""found"" that for folks with under five million in assets at retirement adding an annuity will somehow help with something or other.  And not just any annuity, mind you.  This study looked at dedicating \*half\* of one's portfolio to the annuity and then investing the other half aggressively in equities.

Quote from the article: ""In general, we find the hybrid option does well under a wide range of personal circumstances and preferences,” said co-author Mark Warshawsky, CEO of the research firm ReLIA Strategies and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.""

I don't know what ""does well"" means here.  Did it yield more money per month?  More money over time?  Did it mitigate portfolio failure?  Since the 4% rule has a confidence interval of 95 percent in back testing, what value exactly does an annuity add here?  

And given the huge haircut one takes on yield when buying an annuity, what is the difference in payouts over time?  Because with the four percent rule you may actually end up with more in your account at the end than when you started.  But with those annuities you generally don't get any back except in certain rare circumstances.

I think it's fair to say the insurance companies are worried now as people start to do their own financial planning.  We can probably expect more industry funded astroturf like this in the future.",1183,446,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1gzjhny/the_insurance_industry_has_started_its_attack_on/

bogleheads,Small business and gifted money,"I am currently in my mid twenties and running a small business. It is my second year and I will have a profit of about $90k this year. My parents are very generous and typically give a sizable gift every year. I live quite frugally and pretend I don’t receive the gift and just invest it into VT and never touch it. I also don’t put myself into any situation where I wouldn’t be financially fine if I were to never receive another gift.

My question is this. If you were to get a gift of about $100k for the next few years how would you go about your finances. Personally I think it is a good idea to take money from my business and max my 401k to lower my tax burden. I would also heavily reinvest into the business to grow it. I would use the gifted money to live off of and I would probably only need about $30-$40k to live off of and I would put the rest of the gifted money into a brokerage account. 

Is this the correct way to look at it? Invest the money from the business to lower taxes and use the gifted money to live off of since there are no taxes on it?

bogleheads,Please explain BND yield/return for me...,"I understand that BND is a collection of bonds.  Although bonds will mature, BND will not.  

I understand that the price of BND will go down as interest rate goes up.  This is because it's more attractive to get new bonds with higher yield rather than existing bonds.  Therefore, existing bonds price will go down.  

I also understand that for individual bonds, its yield will go up as the bond price goes down. This is because bond interest payment is a fixed amount, and since its price goes down, its yield goes up. 

Therefore, as BND price goes down, its yield actually goes up which would offset some of its loss.  

Do I understand this correctly?  If so, how much does the yield offset the loss of price?  Currently BND price was down 13% for the past 5 years.  If I purchased it exactly 5 years ago, what's the actual return? 

Is there a place to check its yield over time?

Conversely, it's expected that BND price will go up due to interest rate cut (pending on how crazy the traffic war is going to be and if inflation will come back).  As BND price goes up, its yield will come down, which would reduce its return? ",42,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1h03e0l/please_explain_bnd_yieldreturn_for_me/

To be honest I am pretty naïve about Bond investing but I know we need to protect our assets as we get older.  
  
A few issues I have is there is little to no info about the Vanguard Institutional Bond Fund. It does not pay a dividend at all so the only way it grows is by capital appreciation . The expense ratio is .024%  
  
Now the Fidelity Fund does pay a dividend and the expense ratio is .30%  
  
If the Vanguard fund doesn't pay a dividend what is the purpose of this fund?  
I can see the Fidelity fund return and its yield I do not know which one is a better fund to be in.  
  
I guess I cant get my head around how the Vanguard fund that has no yield can benefit us as we transition towards retirement and protecting our money and having less risk.

I knew nothing about investing and didn't do much beyond that for a few years.  As I became more established, I used the same guy for a taxable brokerage for retirement and then a backdoor Roth-IRA.  Over the years, I've learned slowly and have finally progressed to the point that I've realized the fees that I'm being charged are seriously hindering what my money could be doing for me.  I thinks that it is time to leave EJ but I'm very apprehensive.  EJ holds about $250K of my money.  I'm 44 years old.  I'm giving them $2,500/mo and maxing out the Roth for the last 2 years that I've been in it.  I also have a 401K through Nationwide that I max out and get a match plus profit sharing and I have a small ETrade account that I have a few dollars in to play with as I learn.  Regarding my EJ funds;

My taxable brokerage (\~$145K) is invested in CWGIX/ANWPX/SMCWX/TAIAX/AWSHX/AFTEX/GAIOX

My Roth-IRA (\~$15K) is invested in FIFAX/SFCWX/MPHQX/HGIFX/JGVVX/MDIZX

529 #1 (\~$49K) is invested in CTHAX/CGFAX (target 2031)

529 #2 (\~$38K) is invested in CTLAX/CGFAX (target 2035)

After extensive research, it seems like Fidelity would be a good fit.  I guess I'm apprehensive because 1) I'm unsure if all of these accounts will transfer over and I'm very worried about taking a big tax hit with liquidation.  How do I tell what accounts are proprietary EJ and have to be liquidated first before transfer? 2) I like having an advisor to bounce things off and to help guide me as I'm still learning but I'm also getting more comfortable doing things on my own.  If I use a Fidelity advisor, won't Fidelity just try to put me into their own funds same as EJ does?  What makes them different?  Can a Fidelity advisor help me understand the tax implications of my moves?  My intention would be to get out of these expensive and lack luster performing funds all together and into new funds.

I've been thinking FZROX/FZILX/FXNAX at 60/20/20 for the Roth-IRA and then FSKAX/FTIHX at 80/20 in my taxable.  Hoping to just set it and forget it.  I have no ideas what I would do with the 529s.

Despite my concerns about the nickel and dimeing by EJ, I will be forever grateful for the start and the forced education that has helped put me on better footing than most others out there.

We recently sold a property and want to dedicate the proceeds to our three children's 529 plans. We live in New York state.

I am looking at two options: 

1. Lump sum the amounts into the 3 accounts, take the state tax deduction one time, let it ride to hit the target savings number. 

2. Put in a smaller initial amount into the 3 accounts in year 1, then max out the contributions up to the full state tax deduction for the next several years until we hit the target.

By my calculations I will end up needing to contribute about $17,000 more in principal with Option 2 to make up for the smaller initial investment. However, I will be taking a $10,000 state deductions for 8+ years.

I recently decided to switch my account to Fidelity, to a self manage brokerage account. Everything transferred over smoothly, didn't have t sell anything as there were to proprietary UBS funds. 

UBS made me a really conservative portfolio, that's' my fault because I told them I didn't want to take losses.



I have 2 options with fidelity:



 Option 1: my plan was to go self managed and have a 4 fund portfolio: 60% US total market, 20% international total market, 10% growth and 10% Bonds. The problem is that what was transferred from UBS is a mess of ETFs (see attached) and asset allocation is really bad with (30.9% domestic, 20.2% foreign, 42% bonds and 6% short term)! So obviously I have to rebalance for a more aggressive portfolio. 



Option 2: I have a call next Dec the 2nd with a fidelity advisor about the benefits of going with a fully managed account (they're the ones who called me and I agreed to listen to them), the highlights are fees of 0.3- 0.7%, and tax loss harvesting. He said that with what with they can save me with tax loss harvesting, etc, they can beat the market by 1%, but I don't know if I believe that. I think the catch here is that the advisor told me they would buy individual stocks (which would be a lot) to mimic the market and then maximize tax loss harvesting, I feel like this would trap me and it would be hard to terminate this type of account,  it I'm not sure.

If I go with option 1, based on my positions (attached), would I have to sell a lot and buy the funds I want and create a big tax event? Or can  trade ETFs so I don't take big tax hit? My first step is to convert about 32% of my bonds to stocks. Would rebalancing be a panfull prcess? is my 4 fund portfolio plan okay?: 60% US total market, 20% international total market, 10% growth and 10% Bonds. Any recommendations? I think I can ride a stock market downturn, hopefully (see numbers below).

Or should I go with option 2 (fully managed account) and tell them to go aggressive a let them do their thing? Would  this be more beneficial in my case? 



Some context that can help with answering questions:

\- $550k portfolio, I max out 401K and Roth IRA every year, will contribute to the rest to brokerage account every paycheck. 

\-  $30k emergency fund, Only debt is $800 a month mortgage (60k balance). I'm not a big spender.

\- 40y/o, thinking about retiring at 55, I currently have $300k (in 401k and Roth IRA). $120Kk salary.

bogleheads,Low-income making $35K CAD / year with $370K to invest. Best way to allocate?,"I am single, 41, self-employed (so my income is not dependable), and only make around $35K-$40K CAD year. However, I live below my means and have saved and invested well over the years, and therefore have $370K to invest through my company. I have no debts, and my place is paid off with no mortgage. 



However, because my income is so low, I don't have much left over after the cost of living (around $30K/year) to invest (maybe $5K - $10K a year at most).



I'm a ""Boglehead"" and previously had 100% of my investments in VFV (VOO), but had to sell it all to move some money around, and in 6 weeks I'll have $370K again (from the sale of an investment property). My original intention was to DCA it all back into VFV (VOO) in something like 5 deposits of $74K spread around 1 month apart each, although having heard that over the long run lump sum beats DCA, I might just DCA.



However, because my income is so low, is unstable, and I have no partner to rely on, I'm wondering if I should have a different allocation.



I know that John Bogle advocated for a stock/bond split, especially as you get older, for more stability, so I was thinking of maybe putting 10-15% in bonds. Then I started to wonder if I should also allocate a portion to dividend ETFs, or maybe even replace the bonds entirely with dividend ETFs (something like SCHD). My thinking is that with my income being low, it'd be nice to not have to rely on a forced sale of VFV/VOO in a down market if I ever need some funds. I'm not sure what is best tax-wise in regards to this, but will talk to my accountant about that.



If I had a regular and secure job, I'd have no problem putting it all in the S&P500, but with no partner to rely on on hard times and being self-employed, having bonds or dividend income that I can ""depend"" on, is very appealing. I was thinking of something like 60% VOO, 30% SCHD, 10% bonds (or 70% VOO, 30% SCHD).

bogleheads,"Would like to start my investment journey using the 'three fund portfolio' approach, have some questions.","Hello everyone, I recently opened an account with Interactive Brokers and I just funded my account for the first time. I've been doing some research so I can make some well-informed decisions with regard to what I buy.

Since it is relevant to my questions, I am from and live in Bahrain, checked the IRS website and I do not believe we have a tax treaty with the USA.

As stated in the title, I am interested in this approach which, based on my understanding, means I would be buying VTI, VXUS, and BND.

My questions are as follows:

1. If I am interested in buying a S&P 500 ETF as well, for example VOO, how should I factor it into the combination of the three mentioned above?

2. Since I am not from the US nor do I live there, I've seen mention here and there how VOO is not advisable since it is US domiciled, and that if I want to avoid certain taxes I should instead get the equivalent of VOO which is domiciled outside of the US? (In Ireland I believe? Not sure what the symbol is.)

3. Following up on the above question, do I have to do the same thing for VTI, VXUS, and BND? As in, do those also have equivalents which are domiciled outside the US?

I hope my questions are coherent, I'm new to this stuff so pardon my ignorance. I just want to make sure I start off right and can build a nice, clean portfolio, thanks.",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1h09s9c/would_like_to_start_my_investment_journey_using/

forex,ANNOUNCEMENT -- P/L Posting rules will now strictly enforced... Including PROP FRIM passing posts...),"The mods have given a lot of slack around P/L posts that don't follow our rules.. mostly because members were just excited to pass a challenge or post up their first day of positive numbers.  However, the amount of (rule violating) PnL porn posts has gotten out of hand... and  the quality of most borderlines cringe level flexing.

&#x200B;

So a refresher on our rule #8 in the sidebar:

&#x200B;

>8.No Gain / Loss (P/L) Porn  
>  
>We don't care how much money you made or lost. Context is everything, and the details matter!  
>  
>Do not post your P/L Porn here unless you're prepared to give a detailed account of your strategy and all factors that went into generating said P/L. You must also give context to account size, and risk tolerance. Showing off 3000% gains and hiding that it was on a $100 account grossly misrepresents yourself, and we will have none of it here.  
>  
>**This also applies to Prop / Scouting firm challenges.**

&#x200B;

# Read the above rule... starting tomorrow there going to be timeouts for anyone not meeting rule 8's post requirements... and any 2nd offenses will result in a strict ban.

(we are not wsb.. measure how long your dollar sign is over there if you need that kinda validation) 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And regarding the influx of prop challenge PnL posts specifically:

Ladies and gentlemen,...I hate to break it to you, but while passing a prop challenge is a good achievement for a developing trader, it's not exactly worth ""dunkin' on them fools"" level energy...

Don't get me wrong, it's fine and getting a firm's certificate saying you passed can represent a major milestone in your trading journey.  ... .but consider that it's only a step closer to getting paid, not yet getting paid out.. you're posting a demo PnL with added difficulty from structured rules to follow.

Wanna flex your prop challenge pass?

* Show us how you nailed the execution of your strategy and didn't error trade your way to a fail
* Show us a trade that went south quick and  how you handled it
* Show us your biggest mistake, or most silly mistake, and tell us what you worked out to avoid it going forward.
* Read rule 8 again and also include the context, general idea of the strategy, risk you set on trades, etc...

Flex the stuff that will bring you closer to a payout. Post the stats, post the context (plan, method, etc..) and tell us about why you're sharing it...

I'll give some background, I'm 24 years old, I worked as a low level FC at one of the biggest financial firms in the US. I ended up leaving (prematurely) after rigorously testing this EA I built. I couldn't stay and let it run (legally), as a registered rep I was told I'm limited to some small X number of day trades a quarter and it wouldn't have worked out. I prefer the investment side of finance anyways so I wanted to lean towards that even if it meant on my own without a salary. I deposited just under $8k and set it and never interfered. I finally exported everything today and am going to do further analysis but I got excited thinking about what I made here and wanted to share/inspire others and do a bit of humble bragging. 

  
Before the jerks come in here and talk about the huge hit it took initially, I gambled and set a much larger lot size than someone should for that account size because the way I saw it, I believe in my system and I need to get to 25ish thousand ASAP so I can allow multipair trading (currently only USDJPY). 

  
I'm going to do a ton of analysis this weekend but I am pleased at first glance how it has turned out. Maybe I'll make a follow up with my own critiques at a later date. 

  
I guess the point of this post is to brag a little bit, inspire slightly more, and answer any questions some people may have about algorithmic trading in general, EA's, or the choice to quit a stable job I was lucky to have to gamble on some lines of code.

forex,My response to my previous post. ,"My apologies everyone I have been busy.

So my strategy is basically looking through any currency pair and spend maybe 30mins to an hour analyzing the chart, and then I will simply wait.

But while I’m waiting I go and research the currencies Government, I try to watch for any information that show signs of a potential move, in either way.

I then do some “technical analysis” but I’m using this term very loosely because I basically just go into my notes and see how my past trade have gone like what kind of news/analysis i used as the reason why I placed the trade in the first place.

And then i basically just keep sitting until I see an opportunity. Sometimes I’ll sit for a whole 2 hours and not find opportunities to place a trade.

And I mean I won’t even place a trade if my mindset changes. Like I can be sitting there and see an opportunity but let’s say I’m hungry or forgot to drink water or use the restroom or whatever the case may be. I only take trades when I’m 100 percent sure that everything matches my trading notes.

**im about to load this on a demo, lets go!**

Achieving **zero margin** in a Martingale/Anti-Martingale system is highly challenging, especially since margin requirements depend on the broker, asset, lot sizes, and leverage. However, we can **minimize margin impact** by balancing positions and maintaining a close-to-perfect hedge.

Here's how you can approach this:

# 1. Steps to Minimize Margin (Achieving Zero Net Exposure)

1. **Match Total Lot Sizes**:
   * Ensure that the cumulative **lot sizes for Martingale** trades closely match the **lot sizes for Anti-Martingale** trades at any time.
   * Example:
      * Martingale total lot size: **6.08 lots (long)**.
      * Anti-Martingale total lot size: **6.08 lots (short)**.
2. **Align Grid Structures**:
   * Use **fewer Anti-Martingale trades** but with **higher lots** to hedge the cumulative Martingale positions.
   * Example:
      * Martingale: Many small trades across a fine grid.
      * Anti-Martingale: Larger trades at fewer levels (target cumulative drawdown).
3. **Adjust for Lot Size Increments**:
   * Use the smallest increment (e.g., 0.01 lots) to refine matching.
   * Example:
      * If Martingale cumulative lot size is **6.07 lots**, set Anti-Martingale to **6.08 lots** to closely hedge.
4. **Dynamic Lot Adjustments**:
   * Use an algorithm or bot to **recalculate total open lots** at every grid level and adjust the next Anti-Martingale trade size dynamically to maintain balance.

# 3. Zero-Margin Configuration Example

# Martingale Trade Setup

|**Grid Level**|**Lot Size**|**Cumulative Lot Size**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|45|0.01|0.01|
|70|0.01|0.02|
|100|0.01|0.03|
|135|0.02|0.05|
|175|0.02|0.07|
|...|...|...|
|2100|6.08|14.00|

# Anti-Martingale Trade Setup

|**Grid Level**|**Lot Size**|**Cumulative Lot Size**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|135|0.05|0.05|
|325|0.14|0.19|
|655|0.40|0.59|
|1075|1.20|1.79|
|1590|3.00|4.79|
|2100|6.08|10.87|

**Net Lots**:

* At every level, the total lot size difference is minimized to approach zero.

# 4. Broker-Specific Optimizations

* Some brokers require margin on **both sides** even for hedged trades, but they may **reduce the margin requirement for hedged positions**.
* To achieve **near-zero margin**, use brokers that:
   * Support **hedging** and calculate margin based on **net exposure**.
   * Offer high leverage (e.g., 50:1 or 100:1) to reduce absolute margin.

# 5. Monitoring Tools

* Use a trading bot or script to:
   * **Continuously monitor margin usage**.
   * **Adjust Anti-Martingale trades** dynamically to keep net exposure close to zero.

# Limitations

* **Transaction Costs**: Spreads and fees may still cause minor imbalances.
* **Market Gaps**: Sudden movements can skew the hedge if not actively monitored.
* **Dynamic Conditions**: Requires active adjustment to maintain balance, especially if new trades are added.

With precise lot matching and active monitoring, you can significantly reduce margin requirements, effectively achieving a close-to-zero margin system.",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1h1b6kw/thread_for_dca_traders/

forex,My personal trading experience from 2019 - 2024. Rant.,"This will be a rant. If anyone want to opt out, now will be the time. 

In 2019 when i got to know about trading and the foreign exchange market, I wanted to make big bucks and i wanted to make it quick. It was introduced to me through a friend who also wanted to do the same. We opened up broker accounts and we hopped on to babypips and got to learn some basics, saw IML videos took $100 courses hoping to make it big. I used to see people flashing money left and right. Buying the holiday home their moms wanted. Buyin the apartment for their fiancee and all that. I saw it all and I wondered. This could be me right? I went through youtube videos like a hungry dog going through the trash can. I literally ruined my eyesight looking at the white meta trader 4 screen day and night.  And the forex gurus out there driving their audis and lambos felt like a joke. It looked like they had it all. It took me a long time to realise that most of them were fake they were just advertisements garnering followers like me. Sucking the life out of thousands of people like me.   
But I understood that there was money to be made. you can invest less and make big profits. none of the other business models lets you make that kind of profit right? Right. I saw that gold moved rapidly and I could make money with a $500 account. And I did. I made like $300 in the first trade that i did with gold and then made even more, around $800 I think. I thought to myself this is it. Im gonna go big. Right? Wrong.   
With superficial knowledge and being 26 I just kept going at it. Impulsive trading, FOMO, revenge trading, maxing out margins over leveraging I did it all. and finally blew a $2000 account. i had $0. none. fun part was, I did not learn anything from all that. after all these years, I still trade, and I trade not to earn money, I trade to understand how I am as a person, because how you trade shows exactly who you are as a human being. it is completely psychological. You got your data you got your fibs, you got ict, rcvisionaries, the random guys out there talking zen shit and all that. In the end its all up to you. In my experience if youre calm inside and youre composed, you lay out your plan, you will be successful someday. it might be 5 years from now. Might be too late but you will be. I am still not successful, I wanna go for the prop firms and get funded but i spaz out of their practice accounts every time, I got this rule if i reach their goals three times in a row Ill buy their challenge and funnily enough every third time I lose. it shows that im not ready. psychologically im not ready.   
the reason behind this long post is I want to come back to this post one day and say to myself that I was in this state and now Im successful or I have learned its not for me and move on.   
thanks to everyone who read throug this whole rant. This is not a success story this is for those average joes out there feeling what I am feeling right now, giving the market everything they had and still going back to the market clawing at it to make back some thing.

forex,Thoughts on XAU/USD short,"I would appreciate advice/thoughts/opinion 
## Higher Timeframe Analysis

- On the 1D Gold had been making higher highs UNTIL Thursday 31 Oct where a higher high was not [formed.](http://formed.Gold) Gold retraced down, breaking the prior lower low, hence forming a ChoCh, to where it formed a lower low. It seems as if it is in a pull back phase right now. 1D is bearish
- On the 4H, price has followed accordingly - It had started making lower lows (after failing to create a high high), creating a 1D demand, of which it rebounded off, breaking the prior lower low, creating a ChoCh. However I am convinced the 4H is bearish due to the strong nature of the supply zones present. The above mentioned ChoCh may have been a fake ChoCh.
- Within the 1D supply zone a 4HR Bearish OB is present. Above that is another 4HR OB, of which price had rejected off twice (could have diminished strength).

## Liquidity Mapping

- Price is approaching a 4HR OB, which is near the recent lower low. I believe IF price reaches this OB it will sweep liquidity above this swing structure.

## Volume and/or other indicator analysis

- The presence of the 1D supply zone, 4H OB within and the fact that this OB is located within the 61.80 fib level add on as an extra confluence to this trade. Upon price reaching this zone, we will assess volume and reaction, to determine wheather there will be a valid reaction (I believe a retracement into a further downtrend) OR if price will target the higher up located OB

Nonetheless, to explain simply, the logic is that the indicator works based of breakouts or impulsive moves. Unintentionally, it somehow manages to catch bottoms and tops of moves.

The trades taken from the signals given are greatly reduced.

forex,"EUR/JPY Analysis: Testing Support at 161.09 – Bulls or Bears to Prevail?
","**Technical Analysis:**  
EUR/JPY is currently testing a significant support level at **161.09**, a price point aligned with the **50% Fibonacci retracement** of the recent recovery from **159.80 to 162.00**. The pair is trading below the **200-period moving average (161.60)**, suggesting a bearish bias in the short term.

The **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** hovers around 40, indicating growing bearish momentum without reaching oversold conditions. The **Stochastic Oscillator**, however, is entering oversold territory, signaling a potential bounce. Additionally, a descending triangle pattern appears to be forming, which could hint at further downside pressure if the support at 161.09 breaks.

If sellers push prices below 161.09, the next targets could be **160.50** and **159.80**, key support levels from prior lows. On the flip side, a recovery above 161.60 could see EUR/JPY targeting **162.00**, a key resistance level and the upper boundary of the triangle pattern.

**Key Levels to Watch:**

* **Support:** 161.09, 160.50, 159.80
* **Resistance:** 161.60, 162.00

**Volume and Sentiment:**  
📊 Volume has risen during the latest decline, highlighting growing bearish sentiment. A continuation of high volume near the 161.09 level will be critical in determining the next move.

**Outlook:**  
EUR/JPY sits at a pivotal support level at 161.09. If buyers can defend this level, a short-term bounce is possible. However, a sustained break lower could confirm bearish control, setting the stage for further declines.

**Fundamental Analysis:**  
The EUR/JPY pair reflects ongoing divergence between European and Japanese monetary policies. While the Eurozone faces economic slowdown concerns, the Bank of Japan’s dovish stance continues to weigh on the yen. Upcoming Eurozone inflation data and BoJ commentary may drive further volatility in the pair.

After so many years you will start to develop INTUITION and this is the ONLY way you dominate trading and yourself. You will make money.

# Executive summary / What really matters

MBUU is a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of a diverse range of recreational powerboats. It is a small cap stock with FY23 revenue at US$1.38b.

**Investment Thesis 1 - Calmer waves than you think:** The Street has overblown the severity of short-term industry headwinds and underappreciated MBUU’s mid to long-term growth runway

* The Street maintains an increasingly bearish outlook towards the recreational boat industry, stemming from a hawkish Fed, which I believe are overblown.
* In the short-term, the Street has overlooked replacement demand from Hurricane Ian that will soften pain from normalizing pandemic-induced demand.  
* In the mid to long-term, the Street has also underappreciated MBUU’s potential to capture growth underpinned by changing consumer patterns and its ripe potential for internationalization. 

**Investment Thesis 2 - A sturdier hull than it looks:** The Street has misunderstood the resiliency of MBUU’s demand profile and undervalued its enviable financial position

* Sales is more resilient to economic cyclicality than at face value due to access to premium buyers.  
* MBUU has a surprisingly low operating leverage, indicating a relatively small fixed cost base. 
* Prudent capital structure, profitable and OCF positive business model places MBUU in a favorable position to scale and offers it a large buffer for failure against downturns.

**Investment Catalysts - Several clear levers for potential stock re-rating/price uplift:**

* Outperformance of Street consensus in upcoming earnings can quell short-term pessimism
* Sell-side conferences MBUU is increasingly participating in can be used to clarify misunderstandings
* An increasingly likelihood and confidence of the US avoiding a recession can revive investor confidence

**Investment Risks:** 

* Underperforming against Street consensus due to stronger than expected subduing of demand
* Persisting inflation coupled with a need for more marketing spend may erode margins
* Potential industry disruption with electric boats gaining more popularity
* Minimal primary research was conducted to validate thesis 1 & 2

**Indicative Valuation of US$94-105 via the income approach:**

# Business Overview - Small cap recreational boat company with signs of trading at a discount

**Overview:** Founded in 1982 and IPO-ed in 2014, MBUU is a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of a diverse range of recreational powerboats. It has 8 brands under its portfolio with the premium Cobalt brands being the most profitable. 95% of its FY23 revenue comes from North America. Size wise, FY23 revenue at US$1.38b and market cap is just shy of US$1b.

**Monetization and value chain:** MBUU manufactures and then sell those boats to consumers (typically, older, richer, white male). The value chain largely consists of 4 steps. **(i)** Product development; design and engineering of the boats, **(ii)** Sourcing of inputs required; largely engines from General Motors and Yamaha, **(iii)** Manufacturing and assembly and **(iv)** selling the manufactured boats via a global network of dealers. 

**Strategic direction:** M&A has become a core part of MBUU’s growth strategy lately, having completed 3 major acquisitions (Cobalt in 2017, Pursuit in 2018 and Maverick Boat Group in 2020) costing >$380m.

**What caught my initial attention?:** MBUU is a small cap stock with only 1 real business model (i.e. making and selling boats). This makes it easier to model and also analyze. Furthermore, it has been trading at a discount for some time and have recently seen its stock price being further punished due to increasing pessimism on economic outlook. I thought that it was worthwhile to dig deeper.

## Competitive Landscape - Evidence of moat within an oligopolistic market

## A lay of the land - Market structure best characterized as an Oligopoly

MBUU’s closest competitors are MasterCraft (MCFT) and Marine Products Corp (MPX), which like MBUU, are also pure-play recreational powerboat manufacturers in the United States. Zooming out, other competitors may include Brunswick (also sells propulsion, parts and accessories), Winnebago (also sells other recreation vehicles like vans) and Bénéteau (French, also sells leisure homes).

## Evident wide economic moat when comparing against its closest competitors (MCFT/MPX) 

MBUU has the most **extensive distribution network** amongst the 3, with 400+ dealers, including c.50% of dealers having >10 years of experience with MBUU’s brands. MCFT and MPX falls short with just 130+ and 190+ dealers respectively. This is a significant competitive edge given that dealer relationships take years to nurture. An extensive dealer network helps to push the product out more aggressively and covers more niche markets, giving an MBUU an edge over its competitors. Looking at the chart above, we can see that MBUU has consistently outperformed MCFT (it’s closest competitor) in revenue growth. 

In terms of **product value proposition**, MBUU differentiates itself by focusing on enhancing its already impressive vertical integration capabilities. Note that both MCFT and MPX currently do not focus on vertical integration as part of their strategy. This will enable MBUU full control over key boat components, allowing MBUU to produce better products with heightened quality control and be more flexible with managing inventories and catering to fluctuating customer demands. Potential for margins expansion will also allow MBUU to price products more competitively vs peers and thus increase overall product value proposition. 

## Thesis #1 - Calmer waves than you think: The Street has overblown the severity of short-term industry headwinds and underappreciated MBUU’s mid to long-term growth runway

## The Street maintains an increasingly bearish outlook towards the recreational boat industry…

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b7jiey94xxwb1.png?width=1004&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce64cf9270b77e28a8e34bdaac4ca3244f8ae265

As observed above, MBUU and the broader recreational boat industry is **seeing a sell-off over the past 2 months, largely in response to prevailing pessimistic sentiments surrounding the global economy** (since recreational boats are seen as discretionary items).

* Firstly, at the root of it, the US Fed continued to hike interest rates in late July, extending the current tightening cycle that began in March-22. The 5pp hike over 16 months is now the fastest in 4 decades and precedent hiking cycles have consistently resulted in US recessions. Higher interest rates coupled with a looming recession adversely impact discretionary items like MBUU.
* Secondly, JP Morgan has just downgraded a key competitor, Brunswick Corp on 11-Sep. The basis of which was an increasingly cautious dealer sentiment into 2H23 based off JP Morgan’s dealer fieldwork and management access.
* Thirdly, a recent earnings call (3-Aug-23) by OneWater Marine, MBUU’s biggest dealer (>100 locations), revealed that the company is “increasingly cautious as demand signals are pointing towards a retail slowdown”. Margins are also impacted because of a price war amongst dealers.
* Lastly, below consensus revenue and earnings guidance from MBUU’s key competitor, MasterCraft (MCFT) just 3 weeks ago also contributed to an industry-wide ripple effect.

## …Which I believe are overblown. In the short-term, the Street has overlooked replacement demand from Hurricane Ian that will soften pain from normalizing pandemic-induced demand.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sanpn2w2xxwb1.png?width=1970&format=png&auto=webp&s=065653b208d50848b03891f081de0d1333ebeae3

Hurricane Ian was a deadly Category 5 Atlantic hurricane formed in Sep-22. It is the most lethal hurricane to hit Florida since the Labor Day hurricane of 1935. The estimated total damages are north of US$75b, including 15k boats destroyed. MBUU’s CEO, Jack Springer briefly mentioned during the Q3 earnings call that “We have not yet begun to see the replacement of boats related to Hurricane Ian. Many of our dealers believe this will be very significant”.

An estimation of the incremental revenue impact from replacement demand arising from Hurricane Ian can be computed as seen in the sensitivity table above. **In my base case, I estimate a $73m uplift across FY24-25.** This is done via a top-down approach by multiplying key assumptions: **(i)** 15k boats destroyed (source: MBUU Q3 earninigs call), **(ii)** 40% replacement rate across FY24 and FY25 (source: sentiments gathered through the various sources informal and formal sources like forums, social media, etc.), **(iii)** MBUU captures 8.7% share (source: latest FY23 market share). 

## In the mid to long-term, the Street has also underappreciated MBUU’s potential to capture growth underpinned by changing consumer patterns and its ripe potential for internationalization. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xyzgjzq2xxwb1.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5273562e78cfa4fdec59f449c03d2aa230405d8

While weaker consumer sentiments may indeed cause a short-term drag in demand for MBUU’s boats, I believe that **demand will remain robust in the mid to long-term, underpinned by structural shifts in consumer patterns that is MBUU well-positioned to tap on**.

* Firstly, according to McKinsey, a younger consumer base is on the rise (pie chart above) – with Gen Z and Millennial consumers already being nearly twice as likely as Gen X or boomer consumers to express interest to purchase a boat. Millennials have already surpassed boomers in 2019 to become the most populous consumer group for boats in the US and Gen Z is expected to overtake them in 2036. The addition of new demographic groups enlarges the addressable market. MBUU is especially well-positioned to capitalize on this emerging trend given that its Axis brand was formed specifically to target a younger demographic.
* Secondly, there is a rising consumer-value for outdoor activities catalysed by covid-19 that is here to stay (bar charts above).
* Thirdly, the rise of subscription-based boat sharing clubs may enhance accessibility to such high-end boats and thus cushion fall in demand if the service take off in the mid-term.
* Lastly, the US$900b of unspent savings by US consumers during downturns provide a source of dry powder, boosting mid-term demand once sentiments are revived. 

I believe that MBUU is **uniquely positioned to capitalize on international expansion,** and this is an upside that is yet to be noticed and priced in by the Street. Currently, there is significant headroom for internationalization. MBUU is overly concentrated in North America, with the region contributing to 95% of FY23 revenue. Yet, MBUU has a portfolio of well-established brands which are already market leaders in the US – such as in the performance sports boats space with Malibu/Axis and sterndrive boat category with Cobalt. Its market leader status in the world’s biggest recreational boat market will be sure to give MBUU significant brand recognition when expanding abroad. Furthermore, unlike its peers, MBUU already has 2 manufacturing facilities in Australia, which is in close enough proximity to service both the Oceanic and Asian market, regions which are seeing the fastest growth in no. of high-net-worth individuals (prime clienteles for MBUU’s products). Tapping on the international market can be a real needle mover as it can drastically increases MBUU’s total addressable market and may thus result in a re-rating of the stock.

## Thesis #2 - A sturdier hull than it looks: The Street has misunderstood the resiliency of MBUU’s demand profile and undervalued its enviable financial position

## Sales is more resilient to economic cyclicality than at face value due to access to premium buyers.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m2dlzra2xxwb1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=e27354ed7e8d16d14fa3b6dd744865c69ef7a578

The same OneWater Marine (MBUU’s largest dealer) earnings call in August that highlighted pessimistic industry outlook also noted that **“Premium inventory is still selling very well”**. Similar sentiments are heard across other dealers. CEO Jack Springer also mentioned in Q2 earnings call in February that “premium buyers looking to purchase and has not really been affected by economic conditions or interest rates”. They are also unlikely to buy a used boat given that social class drives purchasing decision. Hence, MBUU's access to such **premium buyers will provide it with vital insulation against macroeconomic cyclicality**. 

Given that MBUU has a **significantly larger exposure to premium buyers vis-à-vis its closest competitors** (chart above), especially after acquisitions of Pursuit and Colbat, the Street is neglecting the resiliency of MBUU’s portfolio and unfairly punishing its stock price alongside the industry.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ip8hmig2xxwb1.png?width=1255&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f8f006645b2784e914ffe41489b4c1e714019b1

The truth is MBUU’s portfolio resiliency was demonstrated at the onset of covid-19. Compared to its closest competitors, MCF and MPX, MBUU saw the least volatility on its top line. As seen in the chart above, revenue impact on MCF and MPX was almost twice compared to MBUU across CY19-CY20, the height of covid-19. 

## MBUU has a surprisingly low operating leverage, indicating a relatively small fixed cost base. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n3m2qxy4xxwb1.png?width=589&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8a1aeba8fc0a1e012c7b16f68e2d73e4a164566

To further support my argument on MBUU’s portfolio resiliency, I calculated the operating leverage across key competitors. As illustrated in the chart above, MBUU has a surprisingly low 5-year average operating leverage of just 1.70x and 0.86x excluding an anomaly year in FY23. In fact, MBUU has the **lowest operating leverage vis-à-vis its closest 2 other competitors**. This is a positive for MBUU because it means MBUU has a narrower fixed cost base. MBUU’s **profit margins will thus be least affected during a downturn** when production and sales decline since there is a smaller fixed cost base to spread boats sold over. Again, this point reiterates the resiliency of MBUU’s portfolio, which the Street is failing to recognize. 

## Prudent capital structure, profitable and OCF positive business model places MBUU in a favorable position to scale and offers it a large buffer for failure against downturns.

Firstly, MBUU has an extremely **prudent capital structure** with no debt (excluding just $10m of other long-term liabilities) on its balance sheet. This means that **(i)** there is significant headroom to load up on debt to finance future growth plans (e.g., internationalization) and **(ii)** MBUU can easily tap onto the debt markets to raise capital in a downturn when it needs capital to stay afloat.

Secondly, MBUU has a **tested and proven business model** that generated positive operating cash flow since FY11 (earliest data available) and a positive net profit for all these 13 FYs except just FY11 and FY14.

Thirdly, MBUU has proven to possess **robust and consistent cash flow generating abilities** – even during downturns, as depicted in the chart above. Operating cash flow margins is at an average of 13.5% over the last 5 FYs. Note that future cash flow can largely be reinvested back to scale the business (alongside its existing $79m cash war chest; internal financing offers the cheapest cost of capital) since MBUU has no debt to service and still does not pay dividends.

Overall, these 3 factors indicates that MBUU has very enviable financial health that truly puts it in a favorable spot to aggressively execute growth plans while having a large enough buffer to comfortably weather through any short-term downturns. This characteristic is largely still undervalued by the Street. 

## Investment Catalysts - Several clear levers for potential stock re-rating/price uplift

## Catalyst #1: Outperformance of Street consensus in upcoming earnings can quell short-term pessimism.  

FY24Q1 and Q2 earnings call are expected to happen in Nov-23 and Feb-24 respectively. **Outperformance of Street consensus will quell down short-term pessimism** surrounding the macroeconomic downturn as the data will clearly demonstrate to the market that **(i)** replacement demand from Hurricane Ian can partly cushion some near-term pain and **(ii)** MBUU’s portfolio is more resilient than they get credit for. The Street will thus readjust consensus upwards causing valuations to rise closer to my indicative valuation. 

## Catalyst #2: Sell-side conferences like the upcoming D.A. Davidson Diversified Industrials & Services Conference can be leveraged to clarify inherent misunderstandings of the industry and MBUU.  

MBUU is increasingly being invited to and participating at various sell-side conferences. On 6th June this year, MBUU took part in Baird’s 2023 global consumer tech and services conference. MBUU’s stock price rallied 12.7% from 5th to 7th June after the event. After all, these conferences offer valuable opportunities for management to address any misconceptions by the Street. The upcoming D.A. Davidson Conference scheduled on 21-Sep and other potential conferences in the future will give management a **platform to highlight factors that are misunderstood, underappreciated, and overlooked by the Street** – namely **(i)** MBUU’s portfolio resiliency, **(ii)** strength in financial position that gives it buffer to fail, **(iii)** ripe potential for internationalization, **(iv)** industry growth tailwinds backed by structural consumer trends. 

## Catalyst #3: An increasingly likely US soft landing materializing may dispel short-term consumer pessimism. 

Despite the lengthy and still ongoing tightening cycle by the US Fed, the economy remains strong – supported by high levels of income growth. The looming recession indicated by the inverted yield curve does not seem to be coming. The VIX has gradually came down and US banks are now changing their outlook. For example, throughout 1H2023, BofA economist Michael Gapen had been calling for a recession. But he is now in favour of a soft landing after the latest batch of economic data sang a different tune. If this trend continues, alongside the Fed cutting rates in the near-term, the current pessimism surrounding recreational boats may quickly dissipate. Investors may then **instead focus on long-term growth tailwinds bolstering the industry**, specifically evolving consumer trends discussed in Thesis #1.

## Investment Risks

Overall, risks are low, supported by a simple liquidation value analysis (above), suggesting that even in liquidation, MBUU’s prudent balance sheet mean a max downside of just c.75%-83%. 

## Risk #1: Underperforming against Street consensus due to stronger than expected subduing of demand. 

This can happen because **(i)** overestimation of replacement demand from Hurricane Ian, **(ii)** underestimation of the severity of the looming recession and its impact especially on the premium buyers.

‍**Mitigation:** This is a low likelihood risk because conservative assumptions are already used, and a bear case scenario has already been created in the model to reflect this risk. Even in the bear case, FY24E EPS is expected to be $7.64 and target price is $105.07, an 84.8% upside potential. After all, significant pessimism pertaining dampening demand has already been priced in giving us a compelling entry price. Also, past recessions in 1990 and 2001 have demonstrated that demand will typically pick up at least within the medium term – thus, holding on the stock for a slightly longer horizon can reduce risk. 

## Risk #2: Persisting inflation coupled with a need for more marketing spend may erode margins. 

Persisting inflation and need for higher marketing spend due to the current economic downturn may erode margins and therefore impact valuations.

‍**Mitigation:** MBUU’s series of vertical integration initiatives allow for a lean cost structure. For example, MBUU decided to marinize engines for Malibu and Axis branded boats in 2019, reducing reliance on 3rd party supplies. Over time, these efforts will help MBUU better control rising costs from inflationary pressures.  

## Risk #3: Potential industry disruption with electric boats gaining more popularity. 

With sustainability being the hot topic in recent years, electric boats have started to gain significant traction, just like with electric vehicles. MBUU lacks exposure to this fast-growing segment. Hence, any near-term movements or hype pertaining electric boats may shift consumers away from traditional internal combustion engine boats sold by MBUU. Furthermore, this poses a greater threat in the long-term as more customers get comfortable and adopt electric boats.

‍**Mitigation:** Electric boats are still far from mass adoption. Moreover, MBUU can always leverage its cash war chest and underleveraged balance sheet to quickly acquire electric boat capabilities. 

# Indicative Valuation

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yw56kkoudwwb1.png?width=1744&format=png&auto=webp&s=b18078b4172827f63f24b174c703167648013113

## Valuation Overview – Choice of methodologies

I arrived at an **indicative valuation of US$94-105 via the income approach (equal bend of DCF using Gordon growth and exit multiple method)** as the primary valuation methodology. The income approach was deemed more appropriate given its flexibility to capture the unique investment theses highlighted above. Market approach via **(i)** comparable companies analysis (P/E, EV/EBITDA) and **(ii)** analyzing MBUU’s historically traded multiples were used as sanity check against the target output. I did not rely on precedent transactions due to difficulties in finding suitable comparables and inclusion of control premium in such transactions, inflating valuations. **The football field chart above summarizes output from each methodology**.

## Intrinsic Valuation – Discounted Cash Flow Analysis  using Free Cash Flow to Firm 

1) 3FS Modelling: 

To begin, I projected MBUU’s 3 financial statements for the next 5 FYs. Given MBUU’s maturity, 5 years should be more than sufficient to converge to stable, long-term growth rate.

Firstly, revenue was forecasted separately for each of MBUU’s 3 business segments using a **bottom-up approach** by multiplying **(i)** average selling price (ASP) with **(ii)** volumes sold. A **top-down approach** by multiplying **(i)** recreational boat market size with **(ii)** MBUU’s market share was used as sanity check. Thereafter, incremental demand from Hurricane Ian, elaborated in thesis #1 above was added.

* ‍**In the base case**, ASP was benchmarked to US inflation rates with the Saltwater Fishing and Cobalt fishing segments being better able to pass down cost to consumers given the premium customer profile highlighted in thesis #2 above – such profiles are less price elastic and more willing to pay for additional tech and features. Volumes sold was forecasted to see a slight dip before converging to industry growth forecast, underpinned by capturing structural consumer patterns and headroom for internationalization as mentioned in thesis #1. Again, the Saltwater Fishing and Cobalt segments will see more resilience to short-term demand softening due to access to higher end customers as explained in thesis #2.
* ‍**In the bear case**, ASP is assumed to grow slower as customers are less receptive than expected to absorbing higher cost from inflation. Worse than expected macro downturn may also force MBUU to reduce price for certain brands to maintain demand. Waning US economic resilience and overestimation of resiliency of MBUU’s portfolio is baked into projected volumes sold in the bear case.

Secondly, margins are forecasted very conservatively **both in the base and bear case** by benchmarking historical averages. This ignores any margin expansion stemming from the massive vertical integration efforts that MBUU is currently investing in.

Thirdly, capital expenditure, depreciation and amortization are forecasted by taking historical averages alongside relying on management guidance.

Lastly, working capital is projected based on historical DSO/DIO/DPO with efficiency assumed not to improve.

Overall, my investment theses and views are baked into the financial model's assumptions, with the key output depicted in the Co vs Consensus table above.

**2) WACC:**

**‍**Given that MBUU has a deleveraged balance sheet and the target capital structure is 100% equity, cost of equity = WACC in this case.

Cost of equity is computed using CAPM Model. Risk free rate of 4.25% was derived using US 10 Year Treasury Yield on valuation date. Professor Damodaran’s Equity Risk Premium was used as a proxy to derive a 5% market risk premium. For Beta, I chose to be more conservative and used 5 year monthly regression beta (1.61) over a bottom-up beta (1.21). Given that MBUU is a small cap, Size Premium of 3.21% is accounted for and calculated based on size premia in Kroll’s CRSP Deciles Size Study, using the Absolute Method by decile category.

Cost of debt though not necessary was calculated by deriving an implied synthetic credit rating using guidelines from Moody’s. A default spread based on an A2 rating was added to risk-free rate to derive a 5.33% cost of debt. 

**3) Terminal Growth Rate and Exit Multiple:**

TGR was benchmarked using US target inflation rate of 2% and validated with other long-term growth forecast by the likes of IMF, FitchConnect. The US 30-year treasury, often used as a proxy for TGR stands at 4.3%. A conservative exit multiple of 6.23x EV/FY+1 EBITDA was derived from the 25th percentile of my comps set – way lower than MBUU’s 5-year historical multiple of 8x. 

**4) Scenario Analysis:**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xgbeegicewwb1.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=28e89f9f0f72c85517629f5c7985f8ee291dea57

The table above summarizes the bull/base/bear scenarios, their assigned probabilities and target prices. As elaborated in risk #1, varying my assumptions for **(i)** ASP, **(ii)** volumes sold, **(iii)** margins expansion via vertical integration, I reach a $138.14 target price in the bull case and $88.98 target (risk) price in the bear (risk) case – still an 84.8% upside. How each of the 3 factors specifically impact target price from bull to bear case is seen in Fig 3.5. Nevertheless, I believe that the bear case is unlikely to materialize (20% probability) given that very conservative assumptions are already used in the base case and there is ample evidence to substantiate my variance views in thesis #1 and #2.

https://preview.redd.it/w7r6erqdewwb1.png?width=2799&format=png&auto=webp&s=953723f514071b42e059c6f9b7b1dc6d31ee6b1a

**Screening Process:**

Using S&P Capital IQ, I screened for the following characteristics **(i)** public companies, **(ii)** leisure products, **(iii)** business description with “boats”. After which, a manual filtering process combing through each of the companies’ 10-K was done, keeping in mind similarity in monetization model and market cap, geographical segments. This yielded 6 comparable companies in total as seen in the comps table above. 

**Selection of Multiples:**

Both EV/EBITDA and P/E were used because they use earnings denominators instead of revenue or operational metric given that it is a profitable business. P/B was not used because it is typically more appropriate for companies with more liquid assets (which are often fairly valued) vs fixed assets as in MBUU’s case. Forward multiples were used as valuations are inherently forward looking.

# Corporate Governance

B**oard of Directors:**

* Firstly, given the separation of the CEO and Chairman role, there is a clear division of responsibilities between leadership of the Board and Management – no individual has unfettered powers of decision-making.
* Secondly, 8 out of 10 Directors on the Board are independent non-executive directors, meaning that they are able to exercise independent business judgement and act in the best interest of the company.
* Thirdly, while slightly over-indexed in investment banking, the board members offer a wide range of expertise across various industries as seen in the table above. This helps to foster constructive debate and avoid groupthink.
* Nevertheless, we note that gender and race diversity can be improved. Most directors have been serving since 2014, which is a long tenure and may therefore have impacted their independence. 

**Executive Management:** Top management has been together for >10 years – CEO Jack Springer joined in May-09, COO Ritchie Anderson joined in Jul-11 while CHrO Deborah Kent joined in Jan-11. However, the other executives appears to be relatively new.

**Shareholders:** MBUU’s free float account for 97.62% of outstanding shares, meaning MBUU enjoys a diversified base of shareholders. This reduces possibility of price-attacks from sudden sell-offs. There is also material inside ownership, positively aligning the interests of shareholders with agents of the business. 5.07% of MBUU’s shares are currently sold short, lower than MCFT (9.38%) but higher than MPX (0.87%). This highlights upside potential as short-sellers will have to close their positions one day.

investmentclub,Stock Pitch 2: International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM),"This is another piece also published on a blog ([Skeptivest](https://skeptivest.com/)) I run with a friend. I had the chance to speak to a mentor of mine, who works at an FMCG company as an IT manager. I asked if the generative AI buzz got to his company and if there were any plans to act on it. A familiar yet unexpected name came up - IBM

1. Company Overview – IBM, a tech behemoth losing its shine?1.1 The “Big Blue” in a nutshell 

International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), affectionately known by some as “Big Blue” is a multinational tech behemoth. The company operates across various segments, including cloud & cognitive software, global business services, global technology services, systems, and global financing. After selling its consumer computing unit to Lenovo back in 2004, the company has been focused on **catering solely on enterprise clients**. IBM today is a mature, profitable, but slow growing company with a US$133b market cap. 

The company that created the world's first hard drives and designed computers that put the first men on the moon is now relegated to the back of our minds when we think about tech companies. With a decade of slow growth and a track record of missing out on exponential technology trends - is the company just another technological dinosaur on its slow march to extinction? Or has IBM finally developed a winning combination of solutions to turn the business around?

1.2. Breaking down IBM’s businesses  

IBM is a super complex behemoth, so bear with me as we will spend a bit of time dissecting and understanding what we are actually analysing. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ewju2k74rhtb1.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f8a23179dfb6b7fec077c9d3625a3f59f11fceb

The company predominantly derives its **US$60b revenue (latest FY)** from 3 arms (Software, Consulting, Infrastructure) and a small portion from a financing business.

Ever since Arvind Krishna took over the reins as CEO in 2020, the company has sharpened its strategic focus to cover two key themes of helping enterprises to pursue **Hybrid Cloud** and **Artificial Intelligence**. The company also houses one of the largest industrial research organisations in the world with IBM Research.

1.3. IBM Software

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wcpz2ca5rhtb1.png?width=647&format=png&auto=webp&s=80d6b08942425b3306b024641f1f256cb9030771

IBM's software segment provides a wide range of products and services, including Hybrid Cloud Platforms (Red Hat) and Solutions (Automation, Data, AI, Security, and Health). 

***Hybrid Cloud\****

*\*Hybrid cloud is a cloud computing environment that combines a company’s existing private cloud and public clouds (AWS/Azure/Google Cloud etc), allowing for the sharing of data and applications between the two in a secure and controlled manner. This helps businesses capitalise on the scalability of the public cloud while maintaining security for sensitive applications which can still be run on premise.* 

IBM has bet the house on Hybrid Cloud, and so far, it is showing early signs of it paying off. Hybrid platform and solutions ARR stands at US$13.6b for the company according to their Q2 earnings call. The company has acquired and built a strong core of hybrid cloud solutions across the value chain over the past few years ranging from the platforms required to financial operations (FinOps).

In 2019, IBM software purchased Red Hat for US$34b, which today forms a core part of their hybrid cloud offerings. Red Hat’s open-source operating systems and software enables the effective monitoring, provisioning, and containerisation of servers in such systems. RedHat OpenShift, IBM’s leading hybrid cloud containerisation platform, grew more than 30% in Q2 2023 and now has US$1.1 billion in annual recurring revenue, outpacing IBM software’s total 8% growth. 

***One-stop shop for AI curious Enterprises – WatsonX*** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lxflo6o6rhtb1.png?width=1249&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce1abf8da04777bc8ec5aa63f3e2d0bebebb6a7a

With the hype surrounding AI resurging due to the mainstream adoption of large language models, it's easy to forget that IBM actually was one of the first to launch a conversational AI with Watson back in 2011. The company failed to effectively deliver on their marketing hype and was unable to find useful product market fit despite pouring money into hyperbolic marketing about the potential. The first mover advantage was squandered. Today the company and products look more primed to capitalise on this wave of interest in Enterprise AI. 

It is interesting to note that out of IBM’s 2,700 patents across speech, NLP and conversational AI. around 400 were obtained in 2022. 

In March 2023, IBM’s Watson Assistant was also named as a leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Conversational AI Platforms (CAIP), a standard widely respected by global IT managers and CIOs.

1.4. IBM Consulting

An often overlooked point is that IBM is a consulting giant. IBM's consulting segment provides a range of services including **(i)** business transformation, **(ii)** technology consulting and **(iii)** operations. 

IBM’s consulting practice is highly synergistic with their core software offerings. No exact breakdown exists, but most of their projects leverage on their core suite of software products and offer IBM’s expert integration services to help their clients optimise costs and improve efficiency. The company continues to expect consulting revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% and to expand consulting pre-tax margin by at least a point. 

1.5. IBM Infrastructure 

Since their move to spin off their struggling managed infrastructure business Kyndryl in 2021 into a separate entity, IBM's infrastructure segment now focuses solely on providing a range of hardware and software products, including Servers, Storage, and Networking Equipment. Infrastructure comprises two business areas – Hybrid Infrastructure and Infrastructure Support. 

**Hybrid Infrastructure:** provides innovative physical platforms optimised for hybrid multicloud, AI, and flexible consumption. Includes the zSystems mainframe servers and Distributed Infrastructure. 

**Infrastructure Support:** provides integrated services across hybrid clouds to maintain and improve IT infrastructure. IBM offers maintenance and support for IBM, open-source and non-IBM hardware/software. 

2. Historical Performance – Minimal capital gains, but an underappreciated dividend machine2.1. IBM’s historical stock returns can truly be described as “eh”. 

The company has underperformed compared to both larger cap software providers in similar verticals (VMware) and their IT consulting counterparts (Accenture ACN, Infosys INFY). As of August 2023, the stock price has virtually been flat for the past 5 years.

Bears of IBM attribute the prolonged stagnation to IBM’s squandering of every large technological advantage it had under previous CEO Ginni Rometty. In the early 2010s, IBM had a similar share of the public cloud as AWS but eventually lost any advantage it had. As early as 2011, IBM Watson’s natural language processing machine promised to bring transformative changes to Healthcare and Medicine. The combination of hyperbolic marketing and underdelivering eventually saw IBM lose the AI advantage at the time as well.

&#x200B;

2.2. People may be overlooking IBM as a dividend aristocrat 

In terms of real returns (accounting for dividends), there appears to be a bit of a saving grace for them. IBM is what dividend aficionados refer to as an *almost* dividend aristocrat. The company has a current annualised dividend yield stands at 4.63% and has also consistently increased its dividend yield for the past 23 years. Once the company hits the benchmark of 25 years around Q2 2025, they would officially be known as one. This could be a very small catalyst due a potentially heightened interest among income/dividend investors as IBM **officially** joins the ranks of these elite dividend machines.

The high and consistently growing dividend however, could also come as an area of mild concern as disbursements become more taxing for the company. The company has a **current dividend payout ratio (dividends per share/earnings per share) of 73.85%**. It is extremely unlikely that the dividend will increase much more (maybe \~1% sort of dividend growth) without substantial earnings growth. However, If you were an investor who believes in an IBM growth story and the potential of the company, the dividend is certainly a more than welcome “kicker”.

3. Bright spots within IBM’s twin strategic growth sectors of AI and Hybrid Cloud 

In this segment, we will take a closer look at IBM's twin strategic sectors of AI and Hybrid Cloud. We will also consider what holds for Quantum Computing - a heavily invested sector that has yet to produce real returns for the company.

3.1. Artificial Intelligence: Huge opportunity from scaling Generative AI for enterprises underappreciated by the market

When investors try to list AI companies today, most naturally think of generative AI leaders like OpenAI or the AI computing providers like Nvidia. Few will mention or even think of IBM as an AI company.  IBM is an overlooked leader in Enterprise AI, despite not being the first name that comes to mind for investors.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2gn3yd59rhtb1.png?width=865&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef90510125d8f21e8f805b4d3dc013c01be3b26c

In June 2023, McKinsey published an estimate that AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across the 63 business use cases they analysed. The report also detailed a wilder estimate that half of today’s work activities could be automated between 2030 and 2060.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/54sswm5arhtb1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=73f7e916935019015d994a574a383f7f673cecac

An Oxford Economics and IBM study revealed that 64% of surveyed CEOs today face significant pressure from investors, creditors, and lenders to accelerate adoption of generative AI. 

Yet not all CEOs have rushed to adopt AI. Four in five executives today see at least one trust-related issue as a key blocker to generative AI adoption in their organisations. This includes concerns about cybersecurity, intellectual property  (IP) rights, data privacy, explainability, ethics, and bias present in these models. The need for effective and clear regulation of the technology, coupled with effective internal governance tools becomes fundamental when experimenting with such technologies.

This trend would unquestionably favour AI products and companies with a strong track record of compliance and governance as compared to the new players. IBM’s prior experience with Watson Health also created a strong foundation for data security in the organisation. On the front of IP, IBM has recently announced that it would be joining the likes of Microsoft and Adobe in indemnifying their customers of copyright or other intellectual property claims for using its generative A.I. systems.

IBM’s Watsonx.governance\* provides a unique feature set that will help enterprise IT leaders provide more transparency with their AI model usage and possibly to comply with regulations when clear guidelines emerge.

‍***Watsonx.governance:*** *Set to be launched in early 2024, watsonx.governance is a feature set from WatsonX from IBM that helps companies manage the risks of AI by providing tools and expertise for monitoring model effectiveness, maintenance, and compliance. This is valuable for managers in more conservative industries with less direct technology know-how, as AI can pose significant risks due to its reliance on data and the potential for bias and discrimination.*

3.2. Hybrid Cloud: An effective enterprise solution

IBM has bet the house on the continued growth of Hybrid Cloud and so far, the strategy is looking fairly smart. The entire market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20.2% and there appears to be decent headroom to grow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lhiuxejbrhtb1.png?width=903&format=png&auto=webp&s=545277964cf39abd4bf39e0a5cc446733b4d84fe

A recent Harris Poll survey also found that 77% of enterprises have begun adopting a hybrid cloud architecture, which combines public and private cloud resources. Apart from keeping their secure data private, there are several reasons why hybrid cloud is becoming more popular. It allows businesses to avoid the vendor lock-in that can come with a single-cloud approach. It can also help businesses save money by only paying for the cloud resources they need.

Simultaneously, enterprises are increasingly moving in favour of enterprise open-source software away from proprietary software. A RedHat commissioned survey of 1296 enterprise IT leaders forecasted a 17% increase in companies switching to enterprise open-source solutions in the next two years due to the ability to influence new product features and an increase in familiarity with open source framework. Redhat Openshift, as the premier enterprise open-source containerisation platform with a market leading 31% market share (ahead of AWS Outpost/Microsoft Azure Arc), could see a further boost in adoption.

The continued growth and adoption of the hybrid cloud and enterprise open-source will bode well for IBM, who will continue to grow its recurring revenues from RedHat OpenShift and its hybrid cloud infrastructure as the company is primed to capture a larger portion of a growing pie. 

3.3. Quantum computing:  Further than you think, but increasingly be priced in by the market

QC remains in its early innings. Quantum computing (QC) has been marketed to the masses in the most hyperbolic possible way. “Break encryption standards” “revolutionise drug development”. Despite progress in QC and the exciting potential to address a wide range of problems that cannot be effectively handled today, QC remains in its early innings. Current scientific and research consensus is that scaling to enterprise levels is years or even decades away due to physical constraints in achieving fault tolerant computers.

Meaningful breakthroughs in the long-term will likely still be priced in. It appears that the vision for a computing advantage granted by quantum computers is likely decades away. It is, however, extremely important to note how a large part of investors are driven purely by narrative (see the current AI bubble).  The most likely scenario appears that the market will head into a quantum computing winter, where the interest and funding for the sector dries up in the shorter term (\~5 years) before meaningful breakthroughs occur and the narrative shifts.

IBM is well positioned to capitalize on this growth. The IBM Quantum research team is widely considered the leader in Quantum computing worldwide. The company also holds the highest amounts of patents and published research on Quantum computing and technologies. Later this year, the company is set to launch the IBM Condor, an industry-leading 1121 qubits Universal Quantum Computer which will be 21 times larger in quantum volume than its closest competitor Google Sycamore. IBM also has over 60 functioning quantum computers, more than the rest of the world combined.

4. Proven economic moat, stemming from an enduring enterprise brand, synergistic offerings and high switching cost4.1. Enduring enterprise brand

There is a saying in IT that goes: “Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM”.

IBM may not be top of mind for most people when it comes to technology companies, but its brand remains associated positively among IT managers. IBM has a large and loyal customer base that is accustomed to the company's quality products and services. In 2022, the company was named a leader in 34 different G2 market report categories. The company is ultimately still a household name. Interbrand has named IBM as the 18th most valuable brand in the world in 2022, right behind Facebook.

Given the risk associated with the new technology, It's hard not to see the merit for CIOs to experiment with AI with a tried and tested enterprise brand like IBM as opposed to partnering with a newer name in the space.

4.2. Synergistic offerings make IBM the go-to choice for enterprises 

IBM has a successful track record of capitalising on their software to create these “multiplier effects” for their consulting business. After the massive acquisition of Red Hat in 2019 and the Openshift software, the company created $1b of consulting revenue attributable to Red Hat in the first year alone. Red Hat related projects now account for \~$2b of IBM’s consulting revenue, which in turn drives more tangential software sales as IBM consultants make suitable recommendations for the enterprise clients. 

The AI boom and WatsonX could potentially lead to a similar increase in demand for related consulting revenues for the company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/twmzvi7drhtb1.png?width=1301&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2e8d56e8345d317388cd2b7fd87002b6db7d406

CFO Jim Cavanaugh revealed on the Q2 earnings call that AI related signings grew 50% as compared to the first quarter and that he believes it signals “early green shoots” on how IBM will continue to monetise the interest in enterprise AI. To bolster AI consulting capabilities, IBM has inaugurated a ""Center of Excellence for Generative AI"" within its consulting division, staffed by a team of 1,000 AI experts. These experts can work with clients to help tune and operationalize models for targeted use cases aligned to their specific business requirements.

4.3 High switching costs due to entrenched ecosystem

IBM has built up high switching costs for its customers over decades of business. Companies that rely on IBM's software, hardware, and services become locked-in and dependent on IBM's proprietary technology and expertise to run their operations. It becomes expensive and disruptive for these customers to switch away from IBM to another vendor. This is especially evident in the RedHat ecosystem, where enterprises who have already committed to RedHat Enterprise Linux will find it costly to make an OS level switch for their systems. Likewise as more enterprise users are onboarded to the WatsonX platform and develop their customer flows and interactions, it will be difficult to migrate and replicate them to another provider.

5. Financials are healthier than what the market gives IBM credit for5.1. Concerns over IBM’s gearing are overblown  

Critics of IBM point to the staggering $50b in outstanding debt and the high Debt/equity ratio as the key source of concern. This is understandable especially given the current high interest rate environment. 

With the largest acquisition of IBM’s history with Red Hat, the company has seen significantly elevated leverage in 2019. However, it's important to note that the high debt ratio (long term debt/shareholders equity) is distorted largely due to the effect of holding large amounts of treasury stock on its balance sheet (a contra-equity), causing a decline in shareholders' equity of $169b. In comparison, main competitors like Accenture hold only $6b in treasury stock. If we were to take out the distortion created by treasury stock, their debt-to-equity ratio becomes a much more manageable 0.57X.

It also appears that the company is able to readily pay off the long-term debt obligations if one does an analysis of interest coverage ratio. IBM’s current interest coverage ratio of 9.7x may not put it in the same ballpark as its unlevered consulting peers (Accenture, Cognizant, Infosys) but places it ahead of pure-play software providers like VMware (6.9x) and SAP (9x).

In terms of liquidity, IBM also has a winning combination of cash on hand, strong free cash flow and access to capital which includes $10 billion of undrawn credit (one of the largest corporate credit facilities for a US company) with its A- credit rating.

5.2. Robust free cash flow yield shields IBM's dividend

Since CEO Krishna took over the reins in 2021, the company has been on a drive to improve key measures of profitability, especially its ability to generate free cash flow through its product mix. The company’s current 8% 2023E FCF yield places it comfortably above its consulting peers (Accenture: 5%), and pure-play cloud software solution providers (VMware: 5.3%). This level of profitability protects their 4.63% dividend yield.

6. Valuation - Reasonable entry price

We will attempt to value IBM via relative valuation and looking at broker consensus. Admittedly, in the interest of time, we did not build a DCF, which might have been more appropriate to capture how the various growth levers we highlighted above uniquely impact IBM. 

6.1. Relative Valuation 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6x5yqskfrhtb1.png?width=3003&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeb2457f558f2ed15a90210a744cd80580feb677

Broadly, I have divided the comparable companies into two distinct buckets: (i) Large Cap Software companies, (ii) IT Consulting/services companies.

There are limitations in using this method. IBM is a behemoth that operates a diverse (software, consulting, infrastructure) and vertically integrated business. Not many publicly listed competitors have operations with a similar revenue mix and certainy not all at a similar scale.

In comparison to its closest large cap consulting peers such as Accenture which have approximately \~70% of its revenue concentrated in consulting, IBM appears to be undervalued in price. 

A portion of the market still remembers IBM as the lower margin, hardware driven business as compared to a higher margin software and consulting company which makes up 75% of its business today. The key here for an increase in stock price could be for the market to recognise that IBM’s margins warrant a valuation comparable to that of its rivals with superior margins.

IBM’s revenue mix commands 21.25% EBITDA margins, and trades at a significantly lower 1 year forward P/E of 14.7. Infosys (15.68% EBITDA margin) and Accenture (16.98% EBITDA margin), is trading at significantly higher 20x and 25.1x 1-year forward P/E respectively.

6.2. Broker consensus  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/93l6m0ygrhtb1.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8432c0adbc661414099c378b83c471afc9f71a1

The consensus analyst average for 18 analysts put IBM at a $145 price target with a majority (11) of brokers giving a hold or neutral rating to the stock. In July 2023, JP Morgan’s North America Equity Research team rated the stock a hold and a price target of $145 And in August 2023, Zacks Research gave a $155 6-12 month price target. Since starting this deep dive, RBC initiated a buy call on 22 September 2023, with a 6-12 month price target of $188. In essence, the Street is still not very bullish on IBM's future prospects.

Except for the RBC analyst, we believe the Street is undervaluing the growth potential of IBM’s current revenue mix and its ability to convert on the current AI hype cycle. The growth in AI and hybrid cloud will continue to enable margin expansion for the firm.

We noticed that the Street is gradually becoming more bullish with IBM, so analysts re-rating in the near to mid-term may be a catalyst that drives price up. We explore other catalysts below.

7. Investment Catalysts 7.1. Extension of the AI hype cycle

Gartner’s 2023 edition of the AI hype cycle posits that Generative AI is currently in the absolute peak of inflated expectations and for this process to last for another 5-10 years. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5686nevhrhtb1.png?width=1223&format=png&auto=webp&s=04be8234648d19dce5f75979b552db6f65ca4e41

The continued interest and development of the enterprise use cases will continue as long as companies continue to see positive return on investment through cost reductions and efficiency improvements. This ongoing trend will likely bode well for IBM as a leading enterprise AI provider. 

7.2. Successful demonstration of quantum computing applications in commercial settings

A long-term catalyst could be when IBM’s dominant Quantum Computing research position translates into real economic impact and presents a real computing advantage. This will most likely not be realised in the near term as mentioned in the earlier industry outlook component.

Most cutting-edge technologies today are (unfortunately) driven purely by narrative. Should IBM be able to demonstrably feature a strong commercial application of the Quantum advantage, it is highly likely that the stock will see a short-term boost. One such example (albeit it currently being more of a PR stunt) is in the arena of pharmaceuticals research. Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) has recently signed an agreement with IBM in April 2023 to use technologies including quantum computing and artificial intelligence to advance mRNA research. 

8. Key Risks / Where we could go wrong8.1. Failure to deliver on Enterprise AI experience with WatsonX

As a significant gamble to grow its software revenues, IBM has bet big on its WatsonX platform. In spite of the company’s track record of innovation in Digital Transformation and AI, customers may not view IBM as an innovator relative to newer emerging technology providers in the generative AI space. 

The product has reportedly been pushed to 150 global enterprise clients in Aug 2023 in their first 10 days of launch including the likes of Samsung. This number reported, however, is not a clear indication of early success as we do not fully know of the unit economics/pricing of the product to make a good estimate of the potential revenue it can bring in for the company. Should we have any new indicator  of slow uptake/bad product reviews of their core AI products, we should effectively nullify/taper the AI growth thesis.

8.2. Integration Risk & Impact of Constant Acquisitions

With the slew of acquisitions by IBM, the company runs the risk of serious integration risks. The acquisition of Apptio for example, brings along 1300+ new employees in 20 offices globally. It is uncertain whether the new acquisitions may lead to cultural clashes, employee turnover, and operational inefficiencies instead of the purported synergies stemming from the product. 

Constant acquisitions also increase the amount of net intangible assets on IBM’s balance sheet that may or may not translate to cash flow (assets that do not have physical substance, such as patents, trademarks, and copyright). The high total outstanding debt of IBM (\~US$50b) also worsens with each acquisition, which may affect its ability to pursue new growth sectors in the future.

8.3. Recessionary environment affecting core consulting business 

As consulting is ultimately a discretionary business and given the reasonable probability of a recession at the end of 2023, IBM's consulting business estimates may need to be revised downwards even further. 

Key digital consulting competitor Accenture has narrowed their revenue guidance from 8-10% to 8-9% foreseeing such macro headwinds in H2 of 2023. Earnings results from Infosys, Accenture and Tata Consultancy all showed deteriorating IT spending, especially in banking and technology sectors.

9. Concluding thoughts

Should you believe in the growth narrative of hybrid cloud, the enterprise use cases of generative AI, or even the more far-fetched quantum computing advantage narrative, IBM has an incredibly strong enterprise brand with a track record of delivering value for enterprises. If the promise of AI/Quantum computing eventually disappoints or does not live up to its expectations, IBM's Consulting business will continue to gain from their respective hype cycles as businesses today remain committed to learning and experimenting with these cutting-edge (*fashionable*) technologies. As we await Q3 earnings results for the company, we would also look out for cues regarding the company’s ability to deliver the enterprise AI experience that it promised. It is important to note that Q3 has not historically been good for the company due to the renewal cycles of its hardware business. 

IBM presents a **unique, lower risk option to own a company that is selling shovels to the generative AI gold rush and a bet on the continued growth of Hybrid Cloud**. IBM could be an interesting addition to your portfolio should you need a **low-beta, high-dividend yield stalwart with a growth upside**.

We get the rest of the assets, Paramount + (the streaming business), the Film studios, and Publishing divisions for free at today's prices.

Investment Thesis:

Paramount Global is a global media company with a diverse portfolio of assets, including the traditional TV Media network, Paramount + streaming service, Film studios, and Publishing divisions. The company's stock price has been on a downward trend in recent years and is now trading at 0.4x book value. One reason for the pessimism surrounding Paramount is the competitive landscape in the streaming market. Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video are all major players in the streaming space. Additionally, the traditional TV Media business continues to be in a secular decline.

Despite the industry headwinds, the disconnect between today's share price and Paramount's intrinsic asset value is attractive. The TV Media segment alone is worth more than the entire enterprise value of the company at today’s prices, meaning you get the rest of the assets, Paramount +, the Film studios, and Publishing divisions for free. The valuation of the remaining assets is less certain and can be thought of as a free option with a high potential upside. The entire thesis rests upon the controlling shareholder, National Amusements, monetizing the remaining assets.

What is TV Media worth?

Consensus estimates TV Media will make $4.71bn in EBITDA in 2024, down from $4.78bn in 2023, despite CBS having both the Super Bowl and presidential election coverage in 2024. Peer Fox Corp trades at 6.7x EV/EBITDA. Publicly traded broadcasters GTN, SBGI, SSP, NXST, and TGNA trade between 5.7x-7.0x EV/EBITDA. It’s not hard to justify a range of 5.5x-6.0x for TV Media, especially if you believe CBS is a gem.

Using 5.5x-6.0x EV/EBITDA gives us a range of $40-44/share for TV Media. The entire company, not just the TV Media segment, carries $25/share in net debt. Net, that’s $15-$19/share in equity value for the TV Media business or 15%-46% upside versus today's market price of $13.

The point is that Paramount's share price today is well-covered by the TV Media business. The obvious question is how will TV Media be monetized. Will it eventually be spun as a separate entity that Paramount retains a large stake in, allowing the company to continue to benefit from TV Media’s free cash flow. Or will the divisions be sold in conjunction with a plan to sell the non-TV media assets.

The future is uncertain, but the free optionality of the remaining assets is not.

The Rest of the Businesses

The direct-to-consumer (D2C) business, Paramount +, is harder to value, given the losses it generates. Assume it’s worth anywhere between zero (it will never turn a profit) and 2x sales. That gives you a range of 0 to $25/share.

The film studio was worth $8bn when it was involved in M&A in 2016. Assuming the value of the studio has not changed since 2016 and the film studio's 62-acre lot in Hollywood hasn't appreciated in the past seven years is highly conservative. If a buyer will pay $8bn, then that’s $13/share.

Assuming the film studio's 62-acre lot in Hollywood hasn't appreciated in the past seven years is highly conservative but represents roughly $4 per share at today's book value.

Finally, we have the publishing division, Simon and Schuster, a non-core asset.  Paramount agreed to sell Simon & Schuster to KKR last month for $1.62 billion which equates to $2.5/share.

Adding up all of the divisions gets you a sum of the parts of $30-$60sh, or 310%+ upside. The high end of the range would obviously require everything to go right. Evidently, the asymmetry in the shares seems attractive, assuming all of the assets of the company are monetised correctly.

Key catalysts include an announcement to sell all, or spin off, the company at attractive prices or investors begin to recognize Paramount’s intrinsic value is multiples above today's share price.

Balance Sheet

Another reason for the undervaluation is the company's debt load. Paramount has a Net Debt of $15.4bn and Net debt/EBITDA of 5.3x. However, debt is trading in the 70s-100, BBB-rated (Investment grade) and doesn't have a maturity wall until 2026, ~$729mn maturities between now and then. Paramount has time to address these issues. In terms of Liquidity, Paramount has $5.2bn ($1.7bn cash + $3.5bn undrawn revolving credit facility) as of 2Q 23, providing enough firepower and time for management to resolve headwinds.

Overall, Paramount Global is a complex company with both challenges and opportunities. However, for patient investors, the potential rewards outweigh the risks. Assuming there is a 60% probability Paramount fails its transition to streaming and a 40% probability it successfully monetises its assets, the expected value is $14 (0.6*(-13)+0.4*56). At today’s prices expectation of success is less than 40%.

investmentclub,Stock Pitch: Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH),"Enphase is an American energy technology company making micro inverters for solar panels as well as domestic energy storage and energy management systems amongst other energy products. It’s a great company, but became a little bit of a meme stock in the speculative fever dream of 2021-2022 with the stock hitting $336 in late 2022. However with that bubble now deflating, the stock is now trading at $122 and I believe it’s well worth another look. I’ll write one section on each of their major product lines, one on the broader market and macro factors, and finish by digging into their financials. I usually like to examine revenues and margins by product line but sadly Enphase doesn’t report like that.

https://preview.redd.it/846snd8r1onb1.png?width=1511&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e0425fbed090172d3143fa4f024cd4ddc95bc14

# 1.1 - Inverters

Enphase has a fair few products and services, but let’s start with inverters - their original product. Solar panels generate DC electricity from the sun but you want AC electricity to work with the rest of the grid and your appliances. Before Enphase came along you would use a string inverter to get this job done. Connect all of your solar panels in series, and then have one inverter on the output. This is a cheap way of doing it, but has a few drawbacks - the main one is that the output current can only be at most as high as the least efficient panel in your system (think one panel sitting in the shade, or getting dusty). So, In the late 2000s, Enphase invented microinverters, and they’re still the market leader. A microinverter is a separate inverter attached to each panel. It’s a little bit more expensive to set up, but it means you can get typically more energy output as well as making your system more flexible and less prone to failure. The residential solar market as a whole is forecast to grow between 5-15% CAGR for the next decade depending on which market research agency you ask and you can’t have residential solar without inverters.

Nowadays Enphase is one of the leading inverter manufacturers in the USA and is gradually expanding globally. SolarEdge is Enphase’s largest competition . Between them, these two companies have 90% market share for residential solar. SolarEdge makes traditional string inverters as opposed to micro-inverters. They come with a 12 year warranty as opposed to Enphase’s 25 years. This longer warranty is a big draw for Enphase, as is the superior microinverter tech. As an Enphase investor, you may wonder whether 25 years is too high of a warranty to be profitable but I’m confident that their technology really has the reliability nailed down. Solar installers will tell you that SolarEdge’s inverters experience far more failures than SolarEdge and they take longer to replace.

# 1.2 - Batteries

We should all be familiar with the concept of a battery so I’ll keep it brief here. Batteries are an extra, optional, addition to a solar setup. They allow you to store energy when the sun shines and use it up at night time or when it's cloudy. Most grids allow you to sell power back in, so depending on factors like subsidies, tax incentives, and climate, they may or may not make economic sense in different regions. But even if they don’t quite pay for themselves like solar panels do, they will still be attractive to many customers who want to either go off grid entirely or who want backup in case of power outages or natural disasters. Enphase is also pushing into the developing world - there's a strong case for them there amongst wealthier customers in countries like India or Brazil, where local power grids tend to be less reliable.

There is more serious competition in the battery space than in inverters and Enphase takes a lower market share. Still, the battery space is estimated to grow, this market research agency for instance estimates the solar battery market to grow at a 16.5% CAGR between 2023 and 2032 [https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/solar-battery-market-10621](https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/solar-battery-market-10621)

While Enphase’s batteries are not the cheapest on the market, they do come with a more attractive 15 year warranty and their batteries are highly compatible and synergizes well with their inverter business - with customers being able to manage both and view data stats and manage charging via the Enphase app. Installers will generally advise you to go with Enphase for your battery if you have Enphase inverters.

# 1.3 - EV chargers

This is a newer product line for Enphase. So far Enphase has only shipped standard level 2 chargers but by the end of this year will have begun shipping new smart chargers allowing customers to have full visibility into their solar, battery, and EV system and they enable EV batteries to double up as a backup home battery. Enphase has shipped 6,600 EV chargers in Q2 which is lower than 8,600 Q1 due to broader market headwinds (covered later). We’re all aware that most governments in the developed world are pushing for mass EV adoption with most having bans on ICE vehicles coming in the next couple of decades. This will obviously require a lot more chargers to be installed in homes and other buildings.

# 2 - Market, risks, and other considerations

**Distributor inventory**

Q2 of 2023 has been the first quarter of negative sales growth for Enphase since 2020, and they have also released guidance for a weak Q3. On their Q2 earnings call, they explained that one of the major reasons for this is that they will have to ship fewer microinverters to clear distributor inventory due to overshipping in Q1. There is a lag between demand for Enphase’s products and their revenue, because they sell to distributors who sell to installers who then finally sell to customers.

https://preview.redd.it/zxu6e97j1onb1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a4f8a9aa8b0cab8720b1aecbcbeceb1c2ca5926

&#x200B;

**Interest rates**

One of the major reasons that Enphase is performing worse than expected is due to interest rates increasing through 2022. Interest rates have a higher impact on the domestic solar market than they do on most other industries due to the fact that a lot of solar is financed by loans which are in turn paid for by savings on energy/selling back to the grid, leaving the customer with an outright owned solar system by the end of the loan period. So, if you think that interest rates are likely to keep increasing then we will likely see more headwinds for solar. But to me it looks as though CPI is cooling off. My view is that interest rates are not likely to rise much more and should either stay constant or come down slightly over the next few years.

**Price of energy and energy independence**

The price of oil and other forms of energy are another possible catalyst for Enphase. Higher energy prices increase the economic value of solar and lower energy prices do the opposite. Likewise, the war in Ukraine has been pushing many European countries towards energy independence policies. Both governments and individuals don’t want to be subject to Russian control of their energy or OPEC production cuts.

**Global diversification**

In 2022, 76% of Enphase revenue came from the USA. This is down from 80% in 2021 and 82% in 2020 due to their global expansion strategy. But it does mean that the USA is still by far their most important market, with most products hitting the US before the rest of the world. European growth has been solid in Germany, France, and Holland in Q2 and they are still to bring their latest IQ8 microinverters to Sweden, UK, Italy, and Denmark later this year. They also have plans for a new microinverter specifically for developing countries. Enphase expects to continue to generate substantial revenue from the US going forwards, but I also like to see their geographical diversification strategy taking effect.

**Low market penetration**

Enphase estimates that residential solar has only achieved 4-5% penetration in the US so far. In August 2022, the IPC tax credit was increased from 26% to 30%, increasing the incentive for American homeowners to go for solar [https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/homeowners-guide-federal-tax-credit-solar-photovoltaics](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/homeowners-guide-federal-tax-credit-solar-photovoltaics)

. Enphase also anticipates increased EV adoption as bullish for all of their product lines, as well as climate change and increased grid instability due to higher demand.

**California NEM 3**

On the other hand, California, a significant market for Enphase, has recently brought in the ‘NEM 3’ solar billing. This reduces the export rate (amount that homeowners get paid for putting their solar into the grid) by 75%. The effect of this is to push homeowners to pair batteries with their solar setup and increase the resilience of the grid. This is bearish for Enphase in California, but on the upside this may be mitigated somewhat by tailwinds in their battery business.

**Politics**

Another big factor is of course government incentives. Globally, many governments are offering tax credits and subsidies for solar, like the 30% tax credit I mentioned in the US which by the way will be in effect until 2032, then declines to 24% and 22% in 2033 and 2034 respectively. On top of that they get more subsidies and tax breaks for manufacturing with for example the inflation reduction act. But it's not just the US. Many many more countries have these kinds of incentives. In my view this is likely to continue for a while yet as countries try to achieve their net zero targets. It also presents a risk however particularly in the USA. If the democrats win in 2024 then we are likely to see few changes, but if the republicans get in then there could be rollbacks on some of these tax incentives - a headwind for Enphase.

# 3 - Financials

I don't bother with DCF analysis. I find that it depends on too many unknowns which can have a huge impact on the final valuation. Instead I just go off strong financial performance and a solid qualitative thesis - the latter of which I hope I've already presented.

**Valuations**

The company has a market cap of $16.7 billion. On TTM revenue of $2.8 billion, net income $572.6 million, and free cashflow of $865.3 million, this gives us a PE ratio of 29.1 and FCF yield of 5.2%. I like to look at the enterprise value as well as the market cap. The enterprise value is $15.9 billion - lower than their market cap as their debt is well covered by cash on hand. Therefore, the EV is not too relevant and I won’t be covering any metrics on it.

**Past growth**

The company has had very strong past growth in the solar boom of the last few years due to low interest rates, high energy prices, and government incentives. The rising tide has lifted all boats - but Enphase has still outperformed its competitors with a 44% CAGR in revenue since 2020, plus a 51% CAGR in net income and 53% CAGR in free cashflow. Contrast this to their biggest competitor SolarEdge with their (still impressive) 30% CAGR in revenue and 24% CAGR in net income and negative FCF, and we have a clear winner here. I think Enphase has performed well due to their superior technology, a high level of trust from installers, and their constant innovation and push to release new products (they have over 370 patents).

**Balance Sheet**

Everything is very healthy here. They have assets valued at 3.5 billion with intangible assets making up only 300 million of this, and 2.5 billion in liabilities. This gives us 972 million in equity, or 672 million in net tangible assets which is my preferred metric.

The company does not do dividends, but does have a share repurchase program with the board having approved up to $1 billion in buybacks at the end of Q2, and this program will last until July 2026. Assuming they were to buyback $333 million per year, this would be a payout ratio of 38% this year, but this is just an estimate as we don’t know how much they will buy per year and what FCF will look like through to 2026.

**Management effectiveness**

I prefer to use free cashflow rather than net income to evaluate these metrics. My formula is free cashflow/(long term debt + shareholder's equity). For the TTM, that gives us 40% ROIC. Now for return on equity, I'm using simply free cashflow/shareholders equity and that gives us a crazy 89%.

# Final Thoughts

While there have recently been a few headwinds for the residential solar market, I see a bullish outlook in the longer term (10 years) and Enphase appears to be the strongest company in its market. I would class Enphase as a rock solid stock in that it satisfies my biggest criteria for an investment:

1 - Low market penetration

2 - High degree of synergy between product lines and the ability to leverage existing customer base to sell new products

3 - Good brand recognition and respect amongst customers and experts

4 - Consistently innovating and bringing new products to market

For this reason, I think I am looking at a great company on sale due to short term headwinds. I have allocated 5% of my portfolio to ENPH so far and will be aiming to bring this up to 10-15% provided stock price stays the same or drops and no changes to the thesis. What do you think?

\--------------------------------

#### Business Overview

* Kanzhun is the company behind BOSS Zhipin, which has become the largest online recruitment platform in China in terms of average Monthly Active Users.
* **Differentiators:** BOSS Zhipin is **(i)** mobile native, **(ii)** AI recommendation driven and **(iii)** offers a direct chat function with hiring managers

#### Investment Theses

* **T1: Industry Outlook** – BOSS Zhipin is well positioned to capitalize on the online and mobile transition of China’s recruitment industry**‍**
* **T2: Economic Moat** – Reinforcing network effect coupled with a tested and proven product-market fit indicates a highly defensible core**‍**

* **T4: Capitalization Table** – Absence of significant disposal post-IPO lockup period by key shareholders (i.e., founder, early-stage investors) signals strong internal conviction

#### Valuations

* **Relative Valuation:** The market seems to have priced in much of the optism we share as indicated by the valuation multiple it is trading at vs peers. Nevertheless, entry price is still reasonable – though definitely not at a discount 
* **Intrinsic Valuation:** Very conservative assumptions used yielded an intrinsic value of US$17.89 per share via DCF

#### Risks

* **R1:** Growth outside of China may be limited due to product-market fit issues**‍**
* **R2:** Regulatory overhang still remains**‍**
* **R3:** Potential rise in competitive pressure**‍**
* **R4:** Weak corporate governance, especially through its board structure

## 1. Company Overview – BOSS Zhipin is China’s largest online recruitment platform

#### Who is Kanzhun

Kanzhun is the company behind BOSS Zhipin, which has become the largest online recruitment platform in China in terms of average Monthly Active Users (MAU). BOSS Zhipin has an average MAU of 30.9 million users as of 22Q4. 

#### How does the app work‍

Employers post jobs, receive personalized candidate recommendations, engage in direct communication and receive resume upon mutual consent. Job seekers likewise receive job recommendations, initiate direct chats and deliver resumes upon mutual consent. 

#### Unique features

1. **Mobile Native** – Unlike traditional job portals which are mainly used on a web browser on your laptop, BOSS Zhipin was started as a mobile app 
2. **AI recommendation driven** – Unlike traditional job portals that are search-based driven, BOSS Zhilpin leverages data collected over the years coupled with proprietary technology infrastructure to match jobs and candidates 
3. **Direct Chat with Hiring Managers/Bosses** – BOSS Zhipin allows job seekers and employers to initiate direct chat with their counterparties. Hiring managers are also involved earlier on in this recruitment process, making it more efficient since a layer of middlemen (HR staff) are removed. 

#### Striking resemblance to dating apps

In my opinion, the characteristics of BOSS Zhipin make it bear a striking resemblance to dating applications such as Tinder. One, it operates mainly on mobile platforms, allowing users to engage in a less formal process and respond whenever they wish. Two, it enables direct messaging and facilitates instant feedback. Three, it utilizes artificial intelligence-powered matching algorithms.

#### Monetization Model

* BOSS Zhipin primarily makes money from their enterprise users (i.e., employers) through **(i)** charging a fee for each job posted and **(ii)** other value-added tools (e.g., bulk invite sending, advanced filter help, etc.). 
* Notably, BOSS Zhipin has an interesting monetization mechanism, which prices the job posting fee through taking into account of demand and supply of such roles. So, for example, a role with significant demand could potentially be free to post, to attract more job seekers. 
* It does not earn a fee through successful matches – My take is that it is likely difficult to do so anyways, since it is easy for parties to close the deal off the platform without BOSS Zhiping’s knowledge.

## 2. Share Price Movements – Key turning points and events, and how they impacted share prices

By studying past share price movements alongside financial news, I noticed that BOSS Zhipin’s share price has been highly driven by **(i)** regulatory overhang, **(ii)** market sentiments on the Chinese economy, **(iii)** US-China geopolitical tension, which feeds into market sentiments on China, **(iv)** Earnings performance. Thus, forming an opinion of the above and closely monitoring these factors will be crucial for both the initial investment and portfolio monitoring.

**June-21 \[Neutral, Internal\]:** Kanzhun Limited went public in June 2021, offering 48 million American Depositary Shares (a US bank buys shares from the firm, re-bundles and reissues them on Nasdaq) at US$19 per ADS, raising approximately US$912m. 

**Jul-21 \[Negative, External\]:** 

* Almost immediately after its Nasdaq IPO, the company was subject to a cybersecurity review by the Chinese authorities. The platform was required to suspend new user registration in China. 
* Note that this was a period of huge regulatory crackdown from the Chinese government. Didi (China’s Uber) was delisted from all app stores during this same period due to “serious violation“ of cybersecurity laws. Other popular apps like Huochebang and Yunmanman were also probed into for cybersecurity reviews. 

**Feb-22 \[Negative, External\]:** On 24 February 2022, Russia launched a military invasion of Ukraine in a steep escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War. China refuses to condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin for the war and the resulting humanitarian crisis. 

**Mar-22 \[Positive, External\]:** The State Council's Financial Stability and Development Committee suggested promoting the growth of a robust platform economy in order to strengthen global competitiveness. 

**May-22 \[Positive, External\]:** Vice Premier Liu provided explicit reassurances to tech companies during the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and expressed his support for their listings abroad. Liu affirmed that the government would back tech companies in their efforts to go public, both domestically and internationally.

**Aug-22 \[Negative, Internal\]:** BOSS Zhipin announces its 2Q22 financial results, which saw a 12.8% drop average MAU vs the same quarter in the prior year \[[Source](https://ir.zhipin.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kanzhun-limited-announces-second-quarter-2022-financial-results)\]. 

**Oct-22 \[Positive, External\]:** China was expected to start to gradually loosen its zero-COVID policy after the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party

**Nov-22 \[Positive, External + Internal\]:** 

* Initial stages of zero-covid pivot. China issued 20 guidelines for easing its zero-COVID policy including to reduce quarantine requirements and scrap circuit breaker bans for incoming flights.
* BOSS Zhipin’s 3Q22 financial results were also positive, with a 12.5% increase in average MAU vs the same quarter in the prior year \[[Source](https://ir.zhipin.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kanzhun-limited-announces-third-quarter-2022-financial-results)\]. 

**Dec-22 \[Positive, External + Internal\]:** 

* A dual listing on the main board of HKEX was completed under the ticker “2076”. This move certainly helped BOSS Zhipin diversify its investor base and fortify its capital structure amidst US-China geopolitical tensions and uncertainties. 
* Coupled with further covid restrictions relaxation, which hugely boosted investor confidence in China 

**Mar-23 \[Negative, External\]:** Continued geopolitical tension, with the alleged Chinese spy balloon saga in Feb-23, alongside weaker than expected economic data post zero-covid pivot has definitely had a big impact on the overall Chinese stock market. 

## 3. Industry Outlook – BOSS Zhipin is well positioned to capitalize on the online and mobile transition of China’s recruitment industry

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yhnyjvdj99eb1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e1a6d56853f4ad097a98efbfdb779f8314ab403

#### Rapidly growing online recruitment market…

* According to a CIC report, China’s online recruitment market size is expected to reach RMB 251b by 2026 \[[Source](https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2022/1216/2022121600140.pdf)\]. 
* While it is not clear if the definitions are different, UBS is less optimistic, estimating the market to be RMB 110b by 2026E \[[Source](https://www.ubs.com/global/en/investment-bank/in-focus/2022/china-online-recruitment.html#:~:text=We%20estimate%20a%2025.6%25%20market,enterprise%20and%20job%20seeker%20groups.)\]. 
* Nonetheless, UBS is also aligned with the huge growth opportunities – projecting a 25.6% CAGR from 2022 to 2026. 

#### … Backed by key structural trends

* **#1 Increasing penetration of online recruitment driven by the convenience and adoption of mobile** – Due to the prevalence of mobile internet and smart devices, job seekers are now relying more on online recruitment platforms, which have proven to be more efficient and convenient in matching jobs (e.g., you can easily apply for jobs or manage job applications on the subway home without turning on your laptop). Additionally, due to the convenience, such platforms also activate more passive job seekers, which increases the online recruitment market size. Note that China’s online recruitment market is still at an early stage compared to countries like the US. In 2021, online recruitment represents only 35.3% of China’s recruitment services. This is up from 26.8% in 2016. However, this figure is expected to rise to 52.6%, outpacing offline channels by 2026. 
* **#2** **Cost** **per hire for online recruitment is just a fraction of offline recruitment, democratizing such services and making it a more effective recruitment channel** – Online recruitment cost one-fifth of offline recruitment, according to CIC. With lower cost, this enables employers to use talent acquisition services like BOSS Zhiping, and hence growing the market size.
* **#3 The blue-collar segment in particular will stand to benefit tremendously** – Compared to the white-collar sector, blue-collar recruitment is characterized by fragmentation and a strong dependence on offline channels like referrals and agencies. However, due to the growing challenge of finding skilled workers, online platforms will become increasingly crucial due to its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, blue-collar workers generally switch jobs more frequently, with around 2-3 job changes each year on average, making it an attractive segment. 
* **#4 Existing disparity between supply and demand in the labour market –** The overall urban unemployment rate in China is improving, but joblessness among 16- to 24-year-olds is bucking that trend. In Apr-23, it increased to 20.4% \[[Source](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/why-has-youth-unemployment-risen-so-much-in-china.html#:~:text=The%20overall%20urban%20unemployment%20rate,about%2010%25%20in%20April%202019.)\].  

#### BOSS Zhipin is uniquely positioned to tap onto this growth

* BOSS Zhipin, being a mobile native platform (unlike its competitors, which are largely webpage native) is uniquely positioned to tap onto this growing market. 
* After all, founder and CEO, Peng Zhao left his cushy CEO job at rival firm Zhaopin (first and longest-running online job portals in China) to start BOSS Zhipin precisely because he saw an opportunity to enhance efficiency in and capitalize on this market. BOSS Zhipin is built ground-up, through a deep understanding of the online recruitment industry and what it lacks. 

## 4. Economic Moat – Reinforcing network effect coupled with a tested and proven product-market fit indicates a highly defensible core

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sjbsy9vn99eb1.png?width=1056&format=png&auto=webp&s=f658201149b1c8c1a596b532a1d5bbf3b7b34440

**Significant R&D efforts to create an excellent product with high product-market fit**

* BOSS Zhipin has spent an average of 26.1% of its revenue on R&D efforts from FY19 to FY22. This has translated into a world-class product that has gradually overtook incumbent players (Liepin/51job) despite being a latecomer. This signals to us that BOSS Zhipin indeed have strong product-market fit. 
* Note that under US GAAP, R&D costs are largely expensed rather than capitalized. Hence, there is significant intangible assets that BOSS Zhipin has built over years, that is off balance sheet and likely underappreciated by the markets. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g7nhpz4s99eb1.png?width=913&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddf0e96bec868fd19f2fa4de135f12e50a473cb5

**Reinforcing network effect creates a strong economic moat**

* Many tech platforms (like Grab) tend to also have such a flywheel model. In BOSS Zhipin’s case, as more employers join the platform, more job seekers are attracted, resulting in increased interaction and data to train the AI matching algorithm. A better algorithm enhances the job seeker experience, attracting even more job seekers and ultimately leading to more employers. This creates a reinforcing loop that is difficult to break. 
* BOSS Zhipin has already reached a large enough critical mass for this network effect to be quite organic. 
* This is an industry where price is not a key differentiator. Being able to provide reliable matches through data can be a key differentiator for BOSS Zhipin to capitalize on to expand its margins in the future. 

## 5. Financial Position – Prudent capital structure alongside a profitable and OCF positive business model makes BOSS Zhipin primed for growth 

#### Significant debt headroom

BOSS Zhipin has an extremely prudent capital structure with no debt (excluding very minimal operating lease liabilities). Hence, there is significant headroom to load up on debt in the future when the firm is ready and requires capital to scale. 

#### Huge cash war chest

It also has RMB 9.75b of cash (as of 31-Dec-22), received from its IPO issuance that is yet to be deployed. Note that the cash was raised at an attractive valuation (before all the Fed hikes in 2022). This gives BOSS Zhipin significant buffer, but also access to cheap capital (alongside debt headroom) to scale or reinvest into R&D. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/knkxcc0u99eb1.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=07fc31a197900eb89b2f43116420bef8cee9addf

#### Enviable financial position vs competitors

Note that its competitors are in way less enviable financial position. Liepin has only RMB 476m in cash (as of 31-Dec-22) while 51jobs had just a measly RMB 10.5m in cash (as of 31-Dec-21). Nevertheless, note that all 3 companies (BOSS Zhipin, Liepin, 51job) have very low debt on their balance sheets. BOSS Zhipin has a D/E of 0.023x, Liepin has a D/E of 0.059x and 51job has a D/E of 0.085x. 

#### ‍Profitable business model

**‍**Despite aggressive marketing and R&D expenses in FY22, BOSS Zhipin was still able to achieve GAAP net income and EBITDA profitability. Moreover, the company is also operating cash flow (OCF) positive. Note that BOSS Zhipin’s competitors (51job and Tongdao) are also profitable and OCF positive. Unlike other innovative platform businesses (e.g., ride sharing or food delivery), this is a tried and tested business model and industry that is proven to make money.

## 6. Capitalization Table – Absence of significant disposal post-IPO lockup period by key shareholders (i.e., founder, early-stage investors) signals strong internal conviction

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3w3hwrsv99eb1.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=dde9756cd7862326c95d8a3d34caec28b73640ae

It is interesting to note that despite the IPO lock-up period being long over, founder Peng Zhao and several early-stage investors like Tencent (Image Frame Investment) and Banyan Partners have not divested to cash out. This is a strong signal of internal bullishness and conviction. 

While there is no significant indication of insider buying to further bolster this argument, note that as of expiry of the lockup period on 18-Dec-21, BOSS Zhipin was trading at about US$36, which is almost twice its offering price of US$19 at IPO – this would have tempted most people to cash out and realize a profit.

## 7. Valuation Analysis – Reasonable entry price with valuation upside potential 

#### Relative Valuation 

**Screening of comps:** Broadly, I split the comparable companies into 3 buckets, to be separately analysed – **(i)** online recruitment, **(ii)** offline recruitment and **(iii)** general Chinese internet companies. Given the relatively small universe of companies in this space, I was quite lenient with including companies as long as they fall into the recruitment sector. Factors like geography, size, capital structure and growth rates had to be considered less.  

**Limitations:** BOSS Zhipin operates a fairly unique business model, and hence it’s quite difficult to find similar comparable companies. Furthermore, even some of the closer comparables like Zhaopin (delisted) and 51jobs (acquired by Recruit Holdings) are no longer publicly traded.

**Multiples:** Traditional valuation multiples including EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, P/E and P/B were all considered. Given more time, I would also consider multiples with operational metrics like P/MAU. Both LTM and Forward multiples (FY+1 and FY+2) were used. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zzm3fu7y99eb1.png?width=3105&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed6cf458595c9312176846a3963df4b9362e3543

**Analysis:** 

* Looking at the various valuation multiples that BOSS Zhipin is trading at, it is clear that a lot of the optimism that I have shared earlier definitely does seem to be priced in already. 
* For example, EV/Revenue+2 is at 3.7x, which is higher than both Liepin and Recruit Holdings, all offline recruitment platforms and most other Chinese internet comparables. 
* Another example, P/E+2 of 20.8x is also higher than Liepin, all offline recruitment platforms and most other Chinese internet comparables 
* Having said that, while the multiples are on the high side, they are definitely not unreasonable either, considering that **(i)** they are not too far off / significantly higher from peers, **(ii)** there are selected metrics that are trading below online recruitment peers and **(iii)** BOSS Zhipin’s unique positioning vis-à-vis its peers. 
* Nevertheless, this means that the margin of safety is lesser. 

#### Intrinsic Valuation 

To supplement the relative valuation, I did a simple DCF to derive intrinsic value. Very conservative assumptions were used, by referencing broker consensus and market growth forecasts. I did an 8-year DCF, with a forecast until FY30. Some assumptions used below.

* Top-line growth at 6%, in line with market growth rate, and way below analyst consensus expectations (note analyst consensus is >30% yoy growth from 2023 to 2025)
* EBITDA margins to gradually increase to 7.9% by 2030E, driven mainly by decrease in sales and marketing expenses as network effect strengthens  (note analyst consensus is 33.39% by 2025)
* Depreciation and Capex projected as a % revenue and in line with historical figures
* NWC projected as a % of revenue, cogs and SG&A and in line with historical figures
* WACC = 5.55%, using CAPM to derive cost of equity and a synthetic credit rating to arrive at a default spread for cost of debt (note that cost of equity is very low due to the stock’s low beta)
* Terminal growth rate to be 2.5% and exit multiple to be 8.3x EV/EBITDA 

The end result is an intrinsic value of **US$17.89** based on extremely conservative assumptions.

#### Broker Consensus 

Analysts appear to be quite bullish on the stock, as seen below. Unfortunately, I do not have access to the details of the other brokers, nor the equity research reports from any brokers below. Thus, I am unable to dig deeper into this. Nevertheless, all 5 analysts I have access to gave a buy call, though target price ranges quite a bit. 

## 8. Risk Analysis  

#### Growth outside of China may be limited due to product-market fit issues 

BOSS Zhipin employs a unique China-bred recruitment methodology which cuts off the HR middlemen in the recruitment process. Such a model might not easily take-off in other markets, especially where traditional recruitment processes have been proven to be effective for decades. 

Moreover, this model seems to be more effective when targeting blue-collar workers – and thus, BOSS Zhipin’s model may not gel well with developed countries that have low composition of blue-collar jobs. 

**Mitigant 1:** Nevertheless, the sheer size of the Chinese domestic market significantly downplays this risk. According to BOSS Zhipin’s HKEX IPO Prospectus, the company only has 6.1% market share in the online recruitment industry in terms of online recruitment revenue as of 30-Jun-22 \[[Source](https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2022/1216/2022121600140.pdf)\]. Hence, there is still significant headroom for growth – and conquering the Chinese market alone is already sufficiently lucrative (c.18% of the world’s population). 

**Mitigant 2:** Furthermore, BOSS Zhipin can always consider M&A to grow inorganically in overseas markets. Recruit Holdings did the same by acquiring 51jobs to gain Chinese exposure. 

#### Regulatory overhang still remains 

Given the Chinese government’s history with imposing sudden regulations that almost wiped-out entire industries (e.g., education, gaming), BOSS Zhipin is not spared from regulatory overhang – especially since it was subject to a cybersecurity review in Jul-21 and forced to stop taking on new users. Of course there is also the risk of VIEs \[Read more [here](https://www.cliffordchance.com/content/dam/cliffordchance/briefings/2011/10/vie-structure-in-china-faces-scrutiny.pdf)\]. 

**Mitigant 1:** In the near-term at least, further regulatory restrictions are unlikely to be in the government’s interest, given already poor sentiments towards its economy. Guo Shuqing, the Communist Party boss at the People’s Bank of China told Xinhua news agency in early January that “The crackdown on fintech operations of more than a dozen internet companies is basically over” \[[Source](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/09/economy/china-economy-guo-shuqing-ant-group-intl-hnk/index.html)\]. 

**Mitigant 2:** My personal observation is also that the Chinese government has been directing its regulatory grip towards industries that directly affect family-building (e.g., education, property, etc.), in response to addressing its structural demographic problem. To me, BOSS Zhipin is in a sub-sector within the Chinese internet industry that has significantly less regulatory risks. 

**Mitigant 3:** BOSS Zhipin has made a secondary listing on the HKEX. Hence, even if the Chinese government demand a delisting of its ADR on the Nasdaq, BOSS Zhipin will still be able to trade its shares on the HKEX. 

#### Potential rise in competitive pressure 

Existing competitors or new entrants may gear up marketing efforts and therefore, snatch away BOSS Zhipin’s market share. Sales and marketing expenses for FY22 was 44.4% of BOSS Zhipin’s revenue (RMB 2b). Having to keep up with such high marketing spend will impede margins in the long-run. 

**Mitigant 1:** As mentioned above, BOSS Zhipin has a strong economic moat via its network effect. It also has a large cash war chest it can rely on to combat aggressive marketing efforts from existing competitors or highly funded new entrants. 

**Mitigant 2:** Competitors like Liepin (62.6% as a % revenue OR RMB 1.65b in FY22) and 51jobs (40.5% as a % revenue OR RMB 1.79b in FY21) have already been spending significantly on sales and marketing. Yet, BOSS Zhipin was still able to increase its market share over time – due to its strong product-market fit. A further increase in competitive pressure is thus not as threatening as it may appear to be. 

#### Weak corporate governance, especially through its board structure 

Firstly, Peng Zhao, is Founder, CEO and Board Chairman all at the same time. Furthermore, he has 66% voting power (due to a dual class structure). This means that there basically exists an individual with unfettered power of decision-making. This is typically seen as a governance issue, since Peng Zhao can theoretically make decisions that benefit himself more than the shareholders of the firm (i.e., Type II agency problem). 

**Mitigant:** Nevertheless, this can also be seen from a positive angle. Peng Zhao has the most skin in the game and is likely the man best fitted to helm and make tough decisions for the firm (given that he was CEO of Zhaopin, another online recruitment platform, before starting BOSS Zhipin). Having such control will enable him to follow through decisions that others may disagree due to lack of experience dealing with HR services. 

Secondly, out of 9 members in the board, only 3 are independent. The Corporate Governance code in China seems to advocate for more than one-third of the board of directors to be independent directors \[[Source](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/4-502-3042?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true)\]. Hence, BOSS Zhipin fulfils this to just the bare minimum. However, note that one of the independent directors (Wang Yusheng) is a 79-year-old with concurrent positions within the China National Education Advisory Committee and Chinese Alliance of Science Popularization. In my view, it is unclear if Wang Yusheng will be able to fulfil his board duties religiously given his age and other commitments. 

Thirdly, board diversity is clearly lacking. Board members can be broadly classified as Chinese male with a finance or internet company background. All 9 board members are Chinese and there is only 1 female representative. Board diversity is typically seen positively because diversity in perspectives (e.g. gender and age), help avoid groupthink and foster constructive debate. 

## 9. Concluding Thoughts and Potential Catalysts

This is a capital light business playing in a growing market, with a defensible core and attractive unit economics. However, it seems like our optimism is shared by the markets, as reflected by the relatively high multiples BOSS Zhipin is trading at.  Nevertheless, entry price is still reasonable (though definitely not at a discount) and my personal view is that the potential upside outweighs the risks involved. I am planning to make a small position in BOSS Zhipin (considering that I am already fairly exposed to Chinese tech equities via 3067 and that the stock isn’t trading at a significant discount). 

Some potential near-term catalysts include: 

* **Efforts from the Chinese government to stimulate the economy via fiscal stimulus** will boost economic data and revive investor confidence. Recently, we saw the Chinese government announcing fresh news to address the property market \[[Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-02/china-mulls-new-property-market-support-package-to-boost-economy)\]. Perhaps, more attention will be extended to pushing out large scale fiscal stimulus soon. 
* **Improved geopolitical tensions and greater certainty over economic and security policies** toward China from the US will help boost market sentiments and confidence. Unnamed sources have indicated that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to make a visit to China in the upcoming weeks, as reported by multiple media outlets. This visit holds great importance as it could potentially contribute to the enhancement of relations between the US and China. The itinerary, if confirmed, would involve discussions with prominent Chinese authorities, potentially even including President Xi Jinping \[[Source](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/us-china-relations-in-the-biden-era-a-timeline/)\]. **‍**
* **Fresh growth plans announced, aiming to provide further value-add to its existing user base**: BOSS Zhipin has a large user base, which it can potential develop new complementary HR solutions for in the future to provide further value-add, and generate new income streams. Note that the company is well positioned to do this given their existing large cash war chest and high debt headroom. Such actions will also boost investor conviction in its long-term growth.

investmentclub,Stock Pitch #7: Danaos Shipping ($DAC),"We have a stock pitch for you today. We're happy to answer any questions you may have.

For a more in-depth analysis, I have also posted in the Search Of Value Forum. Link to my post there: [https://www.searchofvalue.com/post/danaos-shipping-corp-a-2023-deep-value-opportunity](https://www.searchofvalue.com/post/danaos-shipping-corp-a-2023-deep-value-opportunity)

Market Cap: 1.34 Billion

**THESIS (SECTION 1)**

Our thesis on DAC is based on 3 main points:

1. It is trading at an industry lows in terms of quantifiable metrics (P/B, EV/EBITDA, Debt/Equity, etc.) with negligible debt. The 0.52x NAV multiple also provides significant downside protection.
2. It has secured a large amount of non cancelable contracts (made at all time high rates) during COVID which will account for 2/3 of future revenue regardless of future freight charter rates.
3. The high stable source of contracted revenue differentiates it from competitors by providing it with a large influx of guaranteed future cash flows - in what is generally a volatile industry. This acts as a significant competitive advantage.

Due to these points, we believe that DAC is undervalued, as it is treated similar to risky charter firms which are open to speculation of changes in container shipping rates - in spite of its significant lack of exposure to such volatility due to guaranteed future revenues (see section 7).

**INTRODUCTION (SECTION 2)**

The Danaos Corporation ($DAC) is a Greek freight charter company. It is heavily undervalued by numerous metrics - trading at a EV/EBITDA of 1.89, 0.52 P/B, a 3.52x P/E, and a 0.18x Debt/Equity multiple. As a freight charter company which owns the majority of its vessels, it is not directly subject to changing freight rates in the short term, although it is exposed to changing supply and demand as well as high capital dependance. Companies in the shipping industry are often viewed as a risky investment due to low ROCs and heavy competition. However, this company is currently at a massive discount, and its exposure to risk is limited as 2/3 of the current revenue is contracted until 2025 at the (high) COVID-19 spot rates. Furthermore, these contracts are with liners that are in great financial health, due to the previous few years of high cash flows in the shipping industry. As of June 13, 2023, the average contract for their fleet has 20 months until expiration. $100 million in share buybacks were announced in 2022, of which $40 million have already been purchased. Currently, there is a 4.73% annual dividend yield with a payout ratio of approximately 11.9%.

**GENERAL RISKS (SECTION 3)**

The firm is at its highest ever point in free cash flow - contracted EBITDA locked in contracts over the next 2 years are more than its current Enterprise Value. With the high amount of earnings that are already locked in contracts, the are around 2 valid foreseeable risks we have identified:

1. The decrease of spot rates is a real possibility - for this evaluation we will assume that rates revert to lower 2019 spot rates (about 40% of what they are currently) as each vessel comes out of contract. (Danaos provides vessel-by-vessel rates and contract terms so this is easily projected.) This assumption will only apply to about 1/3rd of the revenue in the next three years with the balance still on current contract rates.
2. The risk of a recession reducing demand may harm the company in the short term, but is somewhat balanced by the shipping industry implementing environmental regulations that will force many vessels to sail more slowly to reduce emissions. This naturally limits supply in the industry, albeit that new vessels are being brought into the market in 2023 to 2025

**MANAGEMENT (SECTION 4)**

Dr. John Coustas is the current CEO and President of the company. He assumed management of the company from his father (who founded the company in 1982) in 1987. He holds degrees in Marine Engineering, Computer Science, and Computer Controls. With a 44% stake, CEO John Coustas is the largest shareholder. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 2.4% and 2.3% of the stock. His stake likely means he is largely in charge of decisions made at the company. Given he has over 30 years in shipping experience with the firm, he may place his main incentive on steady growth instead of attempting to maximize shareholder returns, although this might be balanced by other incentives due to sizable large stake in the company. The company was under extensive strain after the GCF until COVID due to a high level of debt and low charter rates - this prior history may impact the actions which the management of the company undertake with their current cash.

**CHARTER FLEET (SECTION 5)**

The average age of a vessel on the Danaos fleet is 11 years - for reference, depreciation of these vessels starts at ages ranging from 25-30 years. It is possible that current older vessels may be used for additional periods due to the obscenely high recent spot rates (this may be reduced after the intiation of environmental regulation. In any case, Danaos does not have a fleet for which aging is a current risk. Around $530 million was committed in 2021 to building 6 new vessels, which will be delivered in 2024. Prior to this, another 6 second hand vessels were purchased for $270 million in 2021- these second hand vessels have currently yielded around 8% in adjusted earnings. These worn vessels bought at attractive prices shows how Danaos management has a commitment to stable, sustainable growth.

Vessel orders have been placed with anticipated deliveries between 2023-2025, and the increase in Danaos' net shipping capacity is \~12.8%.

**CONTRACT CUSTOMER BASE AND INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION (SECTION 6)**

Due to the recent increase in cash flows which shipping companies experienced during COVID, large numbers of shipping companies are in extremely (historically) healthy financial positions. Furthermore, the majority of Danaos' contracts are Industry Standard Charter Contracts - this means that they are not cancellable and are not subject to renegotiation or change unless in the case of a restructuring or bankruptcy.

In past years (during which the shipping industry was under far greater strain than it is now), Danaos received full compensation from ZIM when it restructured in 2014 in addition to when HMM restructured in 2016 in the form of equity. However, in the case of Hanjin's bankruptcy, no vessel owners received compensation which contributed to Danaos recording a net loss of $366 million in 2016, down from a net profit of $117 Million in 2015 (it is worth noting that the period was also of a general industry turndown).

&#x200B;

[DAC Customer Base](https://preview.redd.it/aoo1h39hf86b1.jpg?width=632&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=578b1ae28bded7129a8b563638e0c89e36ce0c5f)

CMA GM (22%), M SC (15%), and HMM (15%) were the 3 biggest charter contract companies for Danaos in 2022. In the Q3 earning call for GSL (a Danaos competitor with a customer base which partly overlaps with the firm), Ian Webber (CEO) said - “Further, we have industry standard charter contracts, they're noncancelable. We only deal with the really good names. We've never had a bad debt in GSL. It kind of doesn't happen in our industry by and large, anyway. Liner companies are desperate for these ships. They need the charter fleet to run their scheduled services. Without the ships, they don't have services. So it's in their own interest to behave properly. And as George said, they're in the best financial shape they've probably ever been in..” - this summarizes our conviction on the matter. The already low risks of customer bankruptcy are also somewhat mitigated by the firms diverse customer base (their largest customer accounts for 25% of their revenue, followed by the second largest customer at approximately 16%). This risk is already low because of the fact that liner companies have recently come out of a cash flow windfall.

The market share is currently concentrated amongst a smaller number of larger liner companies due to many smaller firms having faced bankruptcy in recent years - this consolidation and increase in supply side power could allow the maintenance of higher freight and therefore charter rates, which could have an adverse effect on the aforementioned supply shifters, benefiting Danaos.

**FUTURE DEGREES OF CERTAINTY ON ALREADY CONTRACTED REVENUES (SECTION 7)**

As mentioned, Danaos has done an excellent job locking in its revenue at the high recent rates seen in the market. Despite this, the stock seems to be treated similarly to other companies in the sector where the market is watching the precipitous fall in daily container rates and selling shipping stocks accordingly. In the case of Danaos this does seem like a baby-and-bathwater situation. 

For context, the following graph shows the container shipping rates (those charged by the liner companies which indirectly then impact charterers at contract renewal) over the last few years. Due to the short supply of container vessels partly created by the port congestion during COVID, liner companies were scrambling for supply and willing to lock in to charters for long periods despite the high rates. The COVID period truly was an outlier for the industry:

**BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO LISTED COMPETITORS (SECTION 8)**

The corporation's main listed competitor is Costamare Shipping ($CMRE). It's market cap is $1.159B, about $250 million less than DAC. It's Debt/Equity ratio is 1.15, compared to DAC's 0.18. It also trades at a higher P/B value (0.54 compared to DAC's 0.52)  and EV/EBITDA (4.36 compared to DAC's 1.89).

The only other listed competitor is Global Ship Lease Inc. ($GSL). It is also valued at a discount, but to a lesser extent than Danaos Shipping. It trades at a higher P/B of 0.72, a higher EV/EBITDA of 3.17, and Debt/Equity of 0.87.

**CATALYST**

We believe sheer value can act as a catalyst for the stock as it shows consistent earnings due to the contracted future cash flows. More media coverage as the stock increases and shows consistent earnings could also have a similar effect. In the case of a decrease in container shipping rates, consistent profits produced by Danaos could help it maintain its value relative to competitors. In recent times, the media coverage has been low due to the fact that the firm was unestablished and not immensely profitable until after COVID.",17,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/InvestmentClub/comments/14aatpf/stock_pitch_7_danaos_shipping_dac/

The mod Zurevu has deleted his reddit account, we were informed beforehand he will slightly reduce his activity, but this is unexpected, him and I do share the google account of the sub’s google sheet, so I hope in the future if he wishes to comeback he will be able to identify himself from there.

# Reddit API situation:

We have a lot of respect for the other subs going private but we will not do so ourselves, instead we will try to minimize announcement posts starting from June 12, but pitches are still welcome, without elaborating too much, the main reasons for the decision are those:

1). our sub isn’t reliant on out of reddit bots at the moment. 

2). The sub just recently came back from inactivity of over a year, to maintain it we are putting the sub's recent comeback as the first priority.

investmentclub,Stock Pitch #5: Columbia Sportswear (COLM)," 

Company overview

Columbia sportswear is an apparel manufacturer. They own 4 brands: Columbia, Sorel, Mountain Hardware, and Prana. These brands tend to be focused towards middle and upper middle class consumers. Their products are available worldwide.

Management

Insiders own a very large portion of the company; currently around 47%. The CEO, Tim Boyle, has been with the company since 1971, and CEO since 1988. His tenure has seen immense growth in the company and the stock. I would consider management of this company to be proven, and aligned with shareholder interests.

Balance Sheet

Columbia has a pristine balance sheet. As of last report, they have more cash than debt which enables them to ride out the cyclical nature of their business, and pursue opportunities when they present. Its current dividend yield is around 1.5% and they bought back 3.3% of shares outstanding last year, giving an owners yield of around 5%. This is well covered by their earnings and the company does not use debt to finance buybacks or dividends. One thing I have noted is that their buyback yield will fluctuate with stock performance. They tend to buyback more when the stock is down (2020 and 2022) and less in good years (2021). I think this is a good use of stock buybacks, as you want them to buy more when it's cheap. 

Growth drivers

Columbia is a cyclical company, however they have demonstrated long term value creation. They have a 10 year CAGR of 12% (per morningstar) compared to their industry average of 5.78%. They specialize in active and outdoor wear, which has proved to be resilient as consumers continue to like hiking, boating, and fishing. 

Their main growth drivers currently are expansion of existing product lines, and international sales growth. In the latest quarter they saw 25% constant currency growth in international markets. This is expected to be a big growth area going forward. 

EPS growth will also be aided by reinvestment into the company. Stock buybacks should improve earnings per share. They also have the flexibility to complete acquisitions if they become available.

Columbia invests into R&D, adding new innovations and fabrics into their inventory. This helps them keep their products relevant and establish consumer loyalty. Anecdotally, their brands tend to be popular among consumers. Columbia and Sorel have been mainstays for years, while Prana and Mountain Hardware are niche brands with long histories. They partner with influencers to introduce new products.

Lastly, They have been expanding their DTC sales. Selling on their own website drives higher margins and profits. This is still a small amount of their overall business, but growing around 10% annually.

Risk Factors

LIke any apparel brand, Columbia faces a cyclical market. This will certainly continue to be true in the future. Columbia has proven to be durable through downturns (it's a 85 year old company) and their balance sheet helps them weather the downturn.

They are also vulnerable to shifting consumer tastes. This is always a factor with apparel. Columbia has proven to be able to stay popular with consumers. Both Columbia and Sorel have been popular for years. They don’t tend to be flashy or trendy which helps them avoid ups and downs of popularity.

Apparel is a competitive market. There are numerous brands competing for consumer dollars. Morningstar gives COLM a narrow moat rating, which is impressive for an apparel maker. This is always a risk though.

Columbia has had problems with supply chains during Covid. These problems appear to be behind them, but since most of their products are manufactured overseas, they do have to be aware of supply chain issues.

Valuation

This is a hard business to value because it is cyclical. I have assumed that they will continue to grow earnings in the low double digits over a long time span. The company has done this in the past and management is confident they can do it going forward. Year to year there can be variations in their growth rate, but I feel confident in their ability to do this averaged over 10+ years. 

I’m establishing a fair value of $85-$90 based on 15x next year's projected earnings ($5.89). This would be below their long term average multiple. This would mean the stock is at about a 12% discount. Morningstar and CFRA have the stock rated as 4 stars, slightly undervalued. This is similar to my findings.

If The company continues its EPS growth, this would yield 13-14% returns over the next ten years.

The stock is dropping into major support levels around $70-71.

Conclusion

COLM presents a decent opportunity at these prices, if someone is willing to hold through cyclical volatility and has a long time frame for holding.

investmentclub,Stock Pitch #3: Dlocal limited (DLO),"# Dlocal pitch

Disclaimer: My real portfolio is 7% Dlocal limited as of March '23.

Note: English is not my first language, so please forgive me if my pitch is not well written, also my time zone is GMT+3 so most questions coming in from America in the evening and later will be answered only the day after.

\-------------------------------------

dLocal is a payment processing platform that allows businesses to accept payments from customers in developing markets (countries).

**An explanation of the business:**

The problem is that charging people in developing countries is not straightforward. Each country has different regulations and different bank accounts with varying rules. Some countries even rarely use bank accounts for online purchases and instead use other alternatives. When a company wants to roll out its product, say in Nigeria, it will require them to allow a lot of different transaction methods. Otherwise, they would have limited payment options and might lose customers right at the last point before purchase.

The solution is dLocal, a company that operates in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, specifically in challenging markets. They enable big companies to receive payments from customers in those regions.

How dLocal works:

1. Integration: Businesses can integrate Dlocal into their website or mobile app by using the Dlocal API. This allows customers to make payments directly on the business's platform.
2. Payment Methods: Dlocal supports a wide range of payment methods, including credit and debit cards, bank transfers, e-wallets, and cash-based payment options. Customers can select their preferred payment method at checkout.
3. Currency Conversion: Dlocal provides currency conversion services to enable businesses to accept payments in their local currency. This means that customers can pay in their local currency, and the business receives payment in their preferred currency.
4. Fraud Prevention: Dlocal uses advanced fraud detection technology to prevent fraudulent transactions and protect businesses from chargebacks.
5. Payouts: In addition to accepting payments, Dlocal also provides payout services. Businesses can use Dlocal to make payouts to their suppliers or partners in multiple currencies and payment methods.
6. Reporting: Dlocal provides businesses with detailed reporting and analytics to help them track their payment processing activity and optimize their payment strategy.

**Financials:**

Markets cap: $4.1B

PE: 40

Forward PE (taken from Yahoo Finance): 26.95

**Terms to know/understand:**

TPV (Total Payment Volume): A metric used to measure the total value of transactions processed through a payment system.

Revenue: Most of Dlocal's revenue is from fees, so they are basically interchangeable terms.

**Q1 2023 Expectations:**

TPV : $3.5B - $3.6B

Revenue: $135M - $138M

Gross profit: $57M - $59M

**Controversial topic:** Muddy Waters did a short seller report on them, I won’t talk about it too much because I think it is irrelevant for two reasons:

1. The report discusses a financial event that occurred in 2019 and 2020. During this time, the company had 5 times less TPV. Since then, the company has grown its business by 5 times or more, so even if any unforeseen challenges arise, the company is now in a position to handle them.
2. Dlocal doesn’t have a lot of customers -- they have around 500 customers. If dLocal really f\*\*\*ed one of their customers, it would be a customer that is able to sue, but no customer that I know of is sueing and their customers just keep using their services… A LOT.

**The hidden potential:** Every time I see a company growing like this I say to myself: Ok, yeah sure, but where is the ceiling? I am not gonna have 5 computers and 15 phones. The growth of a single product is limited...

When trying to find the ceiling of Dlocal you will find that it is very VERY far. The only threat I see to Dlocal is competition. However, Dlocal claims that prior to using their services, their customers (big companies) were handling their own payments in those countries, which can be an inefficient and complicated process. For example, why should companies like Microsoft, Spotify, Etsy, and others have to handle the complexities of managing financials in every country where they do business? This is not their primary focus, and it is much more efficient to outsource these operations to a specialized business like Dlocal.

**Well then what about the future?** Surely other big names in TPV processing will want a piece of the cake when it grows? True, but how long will they take to slowly add themselves to each country in the way that Dlocal did? Will they be able to respond to every solution that Dlocal has for cheaper to attract customers while it not being their main business? Can they really be efficient while not specialized?

My answer to myself for this is: It is possible, not plausible, but I will take that chance.

investmentclub,Subreddit update + recruiting moderators + requesting feedback,"Hello r/InvestmentClub members,

First, let me apologize for the lack of communication and activity in the past. I understand that this may have led to a decrease of interest in this subreddit. In order to rectify that, I want to inform you about some major changes that have been made to r/InvestmentClub...

Moving forward, the sub will be now be hyper-focused on stock pitches and the portfolio. Since there is no need for posts other than official stock pitches and news related to stocks in our portfolio, the subreddit will be set to *restricted.* That means only approved users and mods can post, however, anyone can vote and comment. Posts about the market or specific stocks not related to our portfolio can be made in one of the many other investing subreddits.

Also, we are looking for new moderators to help us grow this subreddit. If you're interested, please check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/InvestmentClub/comments/13u0rju/help_us_grow_rinvestmentclub_by_becoming_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

And finally, I want to inform you what the result is of the recent [poll post](https://www.reddit.com/r/InvestmentClub/comments/12fnf3s/need_feedback_from_the_sub_what_would_be_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about the threshold of ""Yes"" votes needed for a stock pitch to win. The weighted mean was 60.7% which we will round up to 61%.

Thank you for being a part of r/InvestmentClub. I look forward to all of us working together to make this subreddit a unique and fun project and a valuable resource for all investors.

investmentclub,Need feedback from the sub: What would be an appropriate threshold for declaring a stock pitch as a winner?,"Edit: I have calculated the weighted mean based on the poll results, which is 61%. That will be the threshold for 'yes' votes required for our club to buy the stock in question.

Hi r/InvestmentClub members! I could use your guidance. What should the percentage of ""Yes"" votes be for determining whether or not to buy a stock based on the stock pitch? Please vote for the number that you think will lead to the best performing portfolio while also not being too difficult to reach. And feel free to explain your rationale in the comments. Fyi, after this poll ends, there may be another one to fine tune the threshold percentage or a runoff vote with the top two winners.

By the way, there will be a moderator recruiting and subreddit update post in the near future, so keep an eye out for that.

investmentclub,Non-farm interpretation,"As shown in the figure, 

Traders are ramping up bets on the Fed's 50 basis point hike in March, with fed funds futures now showing a more than 80% chance of a 50 basis point hike, up from about 70% on Wednesday and 31% likely before Powell's first testimony.  
Investors are now digesting Congress testimony from Fed Chairman Colin Powell and the ADP data that suggests the labor market is still fairly hot, as Powell clearly lowered the threshold for a 50 basis point rate hike in March,

That means that if Friday's jobs data were strong, it would be enough to make a 50-basis-point March rate hike a more likely outcome.

One of my news in Powell's testimony at the time was that he indicated more clearly the possibility of a bigger rate hike, and did not mention a preference for a 25 basis point increase.

So a strong non-farm payrolls data on Friday could trigger calls for a terminal interest rate of 6%.

investmentclub,Jarts and Prospectuses,"When I was a kid, we played with Jarts.   I had no idea what a ‘Jart’ was - but I knew this game was going to be fun after realizing that it was a ‘Missile Game’

After a few years (1978?), these things were banned.   Never to be sold again.  Ever.  

Why?   Because to the public this ‘game’ was marketed as a ‘missile game’  that was to be launched high into the air (like the 🚀 suggests) towards your opponent with the intent of not piercing a hole in their foot🤭.   No.  Not at all.  The goal was to land your Jarts in a small circle on the ground….that just happened to be about 2 feet away from your opponents feet.  

If these things were sold with some warnings on the box and not marketed as a ‘fun family game’, they might have survived and been able to be bought on Amazon today.  But not after the brand was ‘ruined’.  It was game over.   

We’ve learned our lessons though.  Now we plaster products with warnings, 124 page ‘I accept’ disclaimers, T&C’s everywhere, etc. etc.  The same can be said for 2-3x leveraged ETF’s.  If you think for a single minute that Proshares is going to recommend that you hold any of their leveraged ETF’s overnight, you are correct.  They will never tell you it’s ok to do so.  Actually, they warn you not to hold these ETF’s overnight.  They learned from what failed ‘Jarts’.

Use your head.  Be smart.  Just because a trading  instrument has risks - that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t or can’t use it how you want to.  That’s the beauty of America.",28,6,https://i.redd.it/leb68enf4fha1.jpg

investmentclub,Update on $OPRA,"First of all, apologies. I have not been active on reddit, so I have not contributed to this sub after my OPRA thesis was selected. I still believe 200% in my OPRA thesis . I thought OPRA was below its intrinsic value when it was trading at about $1B market cap. The stock price action from this year has made me personally realize that market can stay irrational for long time and I think that has been the case with Opera for last 2 years.

I am still invested in OPRA and since added to average down. I believe that market is not valuing Opera correctly and management has been re-iterating it on every investor call this year and are showing it by buying back ADS.  You can read my regular updates over last 1 year on my substack. You can find the link on my twitter once you search for $OPRA. I have been the only one tweeting regularly so you will find me.

Few development since my post on this sub.

1) Opera sold its stake in Starmaker for $83M. Not happy about it though. Opera should have made at least 5x on this if they have held on to this investment considering the growth of starmaker over last couple of years.  
2) Opera sold its Nanobank stake for $127M.   
3) Opera still has $35M remaining on its very timely $50M buyback program. For a reference point, CEO Yahui Zhou personally bought \~1M shares of Opera on open market at \~$8.5 average price last November.   
4) Opera bought 20% stake from a pre-IPO shareholder for $5.50/ADS. Still scratching my head on what desperation drove this multi millionaire Hongyi Zhou, to sell at this much-below-fire-sale price and take $30M loss on his original investment from 2016. Opera now has 3x revenue, profitability, 20% AEBITDA margins, 20+% YoY growth compared to 2016. In 2016, Opera was losing market share, had negative revenue growth and was not profitable and going downhill.  
5) Opera raised both revenue and AEBITDA guidance with Q3 results.  


Overall the thesis remains the same although it is much simpler as apart from its 6.4% stake in Opay, it does not own stake in other companies, so its market valuation is purely based on its own results.

It seems to me that we are finally getting that uptrend started with Opera trading above 200 dma, first time in 2022. Not a single day with 10+% gain in this month but still managed to be up 30% in 3 weeks. It seems to be flying under the radar and in accumulation.  


Not sure if I am overly optimistic with the action from the last 3 weeks, but at some time, market has to rationalize and it has been already 2 years with market ignoring it while Opera continuing to deliver strong results with 29% YoY revenue growth this year and 70% margin growth to AEBITDA margin of  20%, which under current macro conditions speaks to the resiliency of Opera business model. I am optimistic for what 2023 has in store for Opera and would continue to be patient as I watch my Opera thesis playing out.

Daytrading,If it's too good to be true...,"Hey everyone,

I want to take a moment to talk about something that we constantly battle in this sub and is prevalent across the trading world. These scam “too good to be true” posts, and the myth that day trading is a shortcut to riches.

We usually remove these posts quite quickly, but this one unfortunately stayed up for 3 hours today tricking a ton of users. This piece of shit user went so far to post an image of a FAKE a conversation with me, saying to everyone that I approved it.

https://preview.redd.it/s8euakxcia3e1.png?width=937&format=png&auto=webp&s=8138a949a5084af35cbc6d4fd5fa1689888a643f

This is how far people will go to steal your money (further actually - they'll rent Lambos and houses claiming that they own them).

Let me be blunt: **there is NO way to get rich quick in day trading.** **None**. If you’re here because someone on social media, YouTube, or TikTok flashed a rented Lamborghini and promised you the “secrets” to making $10K a day trading from your phone, let me save you time and money - they’re lying.

Day trading isn’t gambling. It’s work. It’s studying. It’s finding edge. It's spending the time. Sure, you *can* get rich gambling, but the odds of you getting *poor* are astronomically higher. For every lottery winner, there are millions of people quietly losing their life savings because they chased the dream of easy money.

Scammers know this. They prey on desperation, FOMO, and the illusion that there’s a magic formula. They’ll sell you overpriced courses, signals, or even access to “exclusive” chat rooms for hundreds or thousands of dollars. Their gains? It’s your subscription money in their pockets.  
  
Before you trust anyone, ask yourself:

* Why are they selling a course if they’re so profitable?
* Why do they need your money to teach you how to get rich?
* Do they show **audited** proof of their success, or just cherry-picked screenshots?

The truth is, successful day trading takes time. It’s about managing risk, developing discipline, and being in it for the long haul. There’s no hack, no shortcut, no “one secret trick.” If it sounds too good to be true, it is. Critical thinking is your edge when you're learning. 

I’m not saying it’s impossible to make money day trading. It’s absolutely possible. But it’s a grind, not a lottery. And you won’t get there by blindly following some influencer with a flashy Instagram reel.

Also, while I have your attention, if all you want to do is gamble and talk about ""Wendy's"" and ""regards"", there is a different sub for that - go there. This is not the sub for that.

If you’re serious about learning this *skill*, start small. Read books, watch *free* educational content, practice on a simulator, and focus on building your knowledge and risk management. This sub exists to share *real* experiences, struggles, and advice - not fairytales.

Daytrading,Reminder:  You are not behind in life. ,"A lot of young men including prior versions of me have gotten this fear of missing out by seeing these fake traders have millions and a great life, when in reality they only show the winners and idealize this lifestyle as easy money you don’t have to work for. I’m talking about the “gurus” that start their tutorials by showcasing a montage of them in LA and Miami saying you could have all this if you buy my course. These people are just marketers, sure they might make money from selling courses, but do they make their primary income from trading, which is probably your passion? No. 

Think what some of your peers are doing. Are they as dedicated as you to making one of their passions work? Probably not, they’re out playing games, partying, or busy with work and college with no desire to take some risks. They probably don’t even consider investing. Naturally, this is fine and not everyone wants to do this kind of stuff, but realizing this helps know it doesn’t make you behind because you aren’t at the level of the “trading gurus”. 

This is a risk to get you financially free within 5-10 years, not 40 like a traditional career. 5 years sounds like a long time to a lot of people, so they try to get rich quick. You have to realize that is 5 years relatively quick in perspective.",61,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1h1xo9d/reminder_you_are_not_behind_in_life/

Daytrading,The Biggest Myths About Trading,"I’ve been trading for years now, and I can’t count how many times I’ve seen people fall for the same myths. These beliefs often hold traders back or, worse, lead to costly mistakes. Here are some of the biggest ones I've encountered:

1. **Trading is easy money.** The classic misconception. People see flashy profits online but rarely the years of hard work and losses behind them. Trading can be rewarding, but it’s far from an easy road. Some people have the audacity to trade with real funds from day one, lost it all, then ask if trading is a scam.
2. **You need to predict the market to win.** Many think trading is about calling every move perfectly. In reality, it’s about managing risk, following a strategy, and maintaining discipline. You can be wrong more often than right and still be profitable.
3. **More trades mean more profit.** Over-trading is one of the fastest ways to drain your account. Quality over quantity always wins.
4. **The 'Holy Grail' strategy exists.** Traders often chase that one perfect system. Truth is, no strategy works 100% of the time. Success comes from consistency and adapting to market conditions.
5. **You need a huge account to start.** While a larger account offers more flexibility, you can start small and grow. What matters more is learning the skills and building good habits.

These myths are dangerous because they set unrealistic expectations. I’ve seen too many promising traders give up or blow accounts because they believed in these illusions.

Daytrading,Hi I'm new. If screeners exist then why can't experts scalp to thousands of percent a year?,"Hi everyone. I'm new to trading, but I have some ideas.

Right now my idea is fairly simple. I start with 50 dollars and scalp a (potentially different) stock for a 0.3% return every day for 25 years. Just wake up a half hour before open, read sentiments on the market and various companies and stocks, wait a bit after open to watch what's moving consistently, then make a purchase. After it goes up 0.3%, I sell and wait for the next day.

It will be a very slow burn, but with no additional input it's not a lot to lose. Originally I thought about adding money in each day (like 10 extra bucks) but then realized I don't even have proof of concept yet. So I'd like to go 1 year without any additional additions first, then analyze what worked if it worked.

I was reading a few other posts about a similar compound strategy where people state use a screener to find potentially larger gains than 1%, as many stocks move 5% within the day.

My question is, before I truly get started with my project, why hasn't this been achieved with screeners? Also, as a newbie, where would you point me to learn the ropes while still holding to conduct one scalp per day?

I'm excited about this. I'd like to hear your thoughts on screeners. Thanks :)",0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1h22kg3/hi_im_new_if_screeners_exist_then_why_cant/
Daytrading,USDJPY Daily Outlook - 28/11/2024,"While USD/JPY’s corrective fall from 156.74 might extend lower, strong support could be seen from 38.2% retracement of 139.57 to 156.74 at 150.18 to bring rebound. ON the upside, break of 153.23 support turned resistance will turn intraday bias back to the upside for retesting 156.74. However, decisive break of 150.18 will argue that whole rise from 139.57 could have completed, and bring deeper fall to 61.8% retracement at 146.12 next.

Daytrading,Not a day trader but Options Post-Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD) is worth looking at,"
I’ve many observations of post-earnings announcement drift. When a stock reports and experiences significant price swings during extended hours or pre-market, it often carries momentum into the regular trading session (PEAD). Gains on average are 25% to 100%  of the premium paid to open the call or put, and are achieved by buying a call or a put depending on stock reaction at market open after earnings. Strike is at the opening stock price, expiration is the week the earnings announcement took place. ZMy trades usually last 5 minutes to 1 hour or less.

What I’m having trouble with is that this strategy requires day trading skills which I have none, I just go by feel, when I reach 25% or more gain I usually close the position leaving money on the table so I’m looking for basic day trading indicators to help try to predict a reversal to close the position (sell to close)",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1h1vmb4/not_a_day_trader_but_options_postearnings/

Daytrading,"I don't know who needs this, but sure I do need to hear this often. ","I am going to list some books that I think are a MUST-read if you are serious about trading. 

**Number 1: Trading in the Zone by Mark Douglas.**  
This is a book I actually recommend reading twice. The reason for this is that your experience in the market, and generally in life, can affect how well you understand the book. The book goes in depth about how our mental framework works. It is critical to develop a ""probabilistic"" mindset. There are so many traders out there who do not understand this concept on a deep level. 

Additionally, there is a difference between understanding a probabilistic mindset and actually practicing it in everyday trading. It is all about our beliefs. I can give you an easy example: If you picture yourself as someone who strongly believes that your money belongs to both of us, would you be upset if I grabbed some money from you? No, why not? Because your beliefs allow me to take it. There is no emotional reaction to this. But if you believed all your money belonged to you, would you have an emotional reaction if I just took some money from you? Absolutely, you would. 

This is the same as trading. The second you place your trade in the market, if you absolutely believe that anything can happen and that ""winners"" and ""losers"" are randomly distributed at any time, then you will be more at peace with the outcome. Once you set the trade, there is no way in the world to know if it's going to be a winner or a loser. If you have a tested system, you would not even care about the result because you know that your system works.

There are many traders out there who have not tested their system properly. The result is that they do not have confidence in their system, which leads to emotional reactions because their beliefs are not aligned with reality. Their minds fear the outcome, and that is why traders get emotional. 

**Number 2:** There is no one else. Just kidding! There is, but this book is actually all you need to understand the mental framework one has to develop. I strongly **believe** that.",28,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1h12k81/i_dont_know_who_needs_this_but_sure_i_do_need_to/

# Intel Snags $7.9B Grant to Expand U.S. Chipmaking

The Biden administration has finalized a $7.9 billion CHIPS Act grant for Intel, the largest award yet in the push to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The funding will back Intel’s factory projects in Arizona, Oregon, and New Mexico—but Ohio’s delayed plant isn’t in the mix just yet.

This deal is smaller than the $8.5 billion initially floated, partly because $3 billion is now earmarked for military-grade chip production. Intel also turned down $11 billion in loans offered through the program, a move that underscores its cautious financial strategy as it navigates a rough patch.

**Chips Down, but Not Out**

Intel’s struggles are no secret—falling revenue, delays in tech development, and fierce competition from TSMC and Samsung have left the company on shaky ground. CEO Pat Gelsinger has mapped out an aggressive $100 billion U.S. manufacturing expansion to reestablish Intel as a chip leader, but execution has been bumpy.

Ohio’s factory timeline has slipped into the next decade, while production at its Arizona site, originally slated for this year, is now penciled in for 2025. Despite these delays, the company has spent $30 billion so far on its U.S. buildout, banking on the CHIPS Act to sustain momentum.

**Racing Against the Clock**

With Trump’s team criticizing the CHIPS Act as wasteful, the Biden administration is racing to wrap up grant agreements before the presidential handoff in January. Intel’s funding offers a critical boost as the company juggles job cuts, strategic reviews, and an uphill battle to reclaim its tech edge.

The $7.9 billion is more than just a lifeline—it’s a vote of confidence in Intel’s role as America’s chipmaking champion. Whether it can deliver on that promise remains to be seen.

# Walmart Steps Back from DEI Efforts

Walmart is pulling back on its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives after pressure from conservative activist Robby Starbuck. 

The company announced it will phase out “DEI” from its corporate vocabulary, reduce racial equity training, and reconsider funding for Pride events. Starbuck had threatened a boycott just before Black Friday unless the retail giant made changes.

**What’s changing:** Walmart will no longer use race and gender as factors in supplier contracts or collect demographic data for financing eligibility. It will also review LGBTQ-themed merchandise, particularly items aimed at children, following complaints. While the retailer says some changes were already in the works, critics see this as a response to Starbuck’s ultimatum.

**A Ripple Through Corporate America**

This isn’t just a Walmart story. The retail giant’s decision reflects a broader trend as companies like Boeing and Deere also scale back diversity efforts. Activists and legal challenges following the Supreme Court’s affirmative action ruling have forced businesses to rethink DEI programs.

For Walmart, the stakes are high. Over half of its U.S. workforce is made up of people of color and women, and it’s invested billions in diverse suppliers. While some argue diversity fosters innovation and talent retention, others see it as a risk in today’s polarized landscape.

**The Big Question**

Will scaling back on DEI hurt Walmart’s workforce and customer base—or solidify its standing with conservative consumers? CEO Doug McMillon, once vocal about racial equity, now faces a tricky balancing act. The retailer plans to fund its Center for Racial Equity through 2025, but its pivot could impact its broader reputation.

For now, the markets approve—Walmart shares ticked up after the announcement was made. But whether this strategy is a retail win or a cultural misstep remains to be seen.

Daytrading, I Customized GPT to Be My Trading Coach,"After reading *Trading in the Zone* by Mark Douglas, I had a serious lightbulb moment.  
That book hit me like a ton of bricks—I finally saw where I needed to fix myself.  
I’ve heard countless times that trading is all about psychology and mental discipline and thought I understood that, but wow, I didn’t have a clue until I dived into this book..

Here’s the thing: nobody knows I’m trading—not even my partner. Okay, my partner *thinks* I dabble in trading here and there, but the truth is, I trade almost every day. I’m fully committed to this. (But that’s a story for another day.) For me, it’s a **lonely** journey. I needed someone (or something) to roast me when I screw up and force me to see things from a different perspective. Not for TA or strategies, but to keep my MINDSET SHARP and my DISCIPLINE in check.

Then I stumbled on a post about how you can customize GPT to an insane level. And I thought—why not give it a shot? I started by talking to GPT about the trading mindset and discussed the core lessons from the book. I asked GPT to summarize the key traits of a successful, consistent, disciplined trader.

Once we had the foundation down, I fed it my own trading system for validation. I gave it clear instructions:

1. **Act as my instructor**—and don’t hold back.
2. Use FOUL language, throw in exclamation marks, and constantly remind me of my goals, EVERYDAY, EVERY TRADE.
3. Treat me like a SOLDIER in boot camp.

The challenge: I told GPT I’d run **20 trades** and report every single one to it. If I violated the principles we set, I wanted GPT to absolutely rip me apart. No mercy.

And here are the answer from GPT after I lost 2nd trade, which was an impulsive trade after winning the first trade.

https://preview.redd.it/7w6z9ejb2b3e1.png?width=1494&format=png&auto=webp&s=e61128e1568a92d3a892f30ee87a904692b1bd49

*It was a long ...brutal answer so I just cropped the last part. GPT even gave me report templates:*

and..well.. you know I think it is working because I felt truly disgusted about my ego..reflected on myself.  
hope someone else finds this as funny too (and maybe useful) as I do.

\+  
If I manage to pass this 20-trade test, will see...if it worked or not 😄

...and this is actually my first post ever on Reddit, my english is not perfect so please be nice! Thanks.

Daytrading,🚀 SNOW Stock Analysis & Options Strategies 🚀,"🚀 **SNOW Stock Analysis & Options Strategies** 🚀

Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) is showing **strong bullish momentum**, currently trading at **$173.70**, rallying sharply from its $107.13 low earlier this year. The recent uptrend has been supported by high volume and favorable technical indicators, but the RSI is at **89**, signaling overbought conditions and potential short-term consolidation.

**📊 Key Levels to Watch:**

* **Resistance:** $180 (immediate), $200 (psychological level)
* **Support:** $150–$152 (moving average), $140 (prior consolidation)

**💡 Options Strategies for SNOW:**

1. **Bull Call Spread** (Best for Moderate Bullish Outlook):
   * Buy a $175 call, sell a $190 call.
   * Limited risk, profit if SNOW breaks above $180.
2. **Long Call** (Best for Aggressive Bulls):
   * Buy a $175 call (30–60 days out).
   * Unlimited upside if SNOW rallies past $180.
3. **Cash-Secured Put** (Best for Conservative Investors):
   * Sell a $150 put.
   * Collect premium or buy SNOW at a discount if it dips.
4. **Iron Condor** (For Neutral Outlook):
   * Sell $180 call/$150 put, buy $190 call/$140 put.
   * Profits if SNOW stays between $150–$180.

SNOW’s strong recovery and proximity to resistance at $180 make it an exciting candidate for breakout plays, but overbought RSI suggests caution. Watch for movement above $180 to confirm the next leg up! 🚀

What are your thoughts? Are you playing SNOW with options or staying on the sidelines? 🧐

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Daytrading,Spouse support?,"Hey, not a trader but the wife of one. I’m looking for advice on how to best support him. I’m a medical student and know only the surface of what trading consists of. when I come home from work and school and I’m fully out of energy to talk let alone dive into the world of finance I need to know if it’s supportive to ask questions on a surface level consisting of the only things I really know and care about -
-was today green or red?
-why do you think that is?
-is there anything you can learn for tomorrow and next week?
-wow that’s wild
Or are there other ways I can be supportive? 

Also- the self finance bit of it. He’s a retired veteran so luckily our mortgage is safe but everything outside of that is being paid for with savings and what little income I do bring in atm.  He’s been sitting at the computer 6-10 hours 5/6 days a week for close to 8 months researching plotting organizing charting, and I truly want him to succeed, but also the bills do need to get paid. How can I support him in trading during the “ON” hours and understand we can’t keep living the way we are with what we have coming in. I don’t want him to feel attacked but we’re getting close to being red all over. 

Any bit of advice would greatly be appreciated! ",2,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1h19row/spouse_support/
Daytrading,Trading Wisdom: Navigating Volatility and Losses,"*Hey everyone, 2 questions*

**1. What's your strategy for dealing with market volatility? Is the main thing to size down?**

**2.  Share your most memorable day/trade and what did you learn from it?**

My most memorable trade was after a 17 day winning streak (1-2 trades per day) and the market was super volatile. The first trade was a 117pt gain on Nasdaq so really well. Apparently that wasn't enough because I entered another trade despite me having a rule of 1-2 trades per day. Well that second trade I lost all the money from the first trade and it was only a 25pt loss. 

My mistake? I oversized the second trade significantly and felt the regret for weeks 😂

I've been trading for 5+ years now and it's safe to say from journaling/reviewing my performance that the best lessons I've learned have been through my losses/not following my rules

Daytrading,What’s worked for me,"First of all, there are many many ways to make money in trading. If my input below helps you, great, if it’s not for you that’s totally understandable too.

I’m someone who’s pretty good at building trading systems. I’ve made dozens, automated and manual. My problem at times has been I spend a few days trading my new and latest system and within a few days I’m working out how to improve it - which leads to whole new systems, and loss of focus on actually making money.

So here’s what works for me, and if you have found yourself going in circles, as I have at times, perhaps it can help you:

1. Trade at 1:2 risk:reward.

1:1 is great for win rate but honestly 1:2 is so much better for day trading. You’ll enter less trades and look for 1-3 trades a day max and be done.

2. Use a fixed SL and fixed TP. Never close a trade manually.

Psychology becomes so much easier when you take away trade management. In all honesty I doubt many traders can improve the profits of their base probability - i.e. letting all trades hit TP or SL is over time going to beat manual trade management. You can then just brush off any losses as you expect them.

3. Trade only one symbol.

Find the symbol that works best for your system and trade it only. Thinking 4 symbols is 4 times the possible entries is largely a fallacy, as you are also increasing the chances for including underperforming symbols. Pick one symbol and optimise your SL and TP for it.

4. Pick one time slot.

Find 1hr or 2hr that give best probability for your system. Yes you will see your entry throughout the day, but actually your brain will filter out all the losses and you’ll end up trading at sub optimal times.

5. Make your system as mechanical as possible.

If your system isn’t mechanical in its rules your backtesting becomes less reliable as it’s damn hard to forward trade what you see in historic charts. I code all my systems in pinescript or MT5, and I use ChatGPT to do it. Seriously, AI has changed the game. I simply press buy or sell when my arrow appears in TradingView. 

And that’s it.

No small feat, but if the above can help you then all you need to do is find a system that meets the above criteria.

Backtest and aim for 50% or higher win rate (33% to break even minus commissions), and you are away.

Daytrading,Quick backtest of effectiveness of SMA on Gold and Treasury futures.,"I bought underlying 5 minute, 12 years historical data from a reputable vendor. Did intraday simple moving averages over a few hours prior to trade, compared to a point at end of trading day, and till end of next day. Just checked if underlying was higher or lower at those later points, not any profit calculation. Played with number of time periods, but always 5 minutes length based on raw data. Filtered for only regular trading hours. Results very consistent regardless of inputs I used. Also tested crossovers vs. for example just keeping a ""rising"" in place till falling replaced, and visa versa...also minimal difference. Didn't do any more complicated like 5/8/13 EMA since you end up with a fraction of number of trades. 

So my question is why do you think on GC gold and Treasuries (true of 2 year, 5 year, 10 year, and 30 year Treasury futures) SMAs were useless? Meaning for example rising GC Gold would actually be a weak indicator for lower prices at end of trade, and rising for lower prices later?

On Treasuries it was slightly worse on 30 years, and basically 50 50 on shorter Treasury futures, so useless.

For equity futures like ES/NQ it was a solid indicator.

Theories on why Gold and Treasuries are so immune to moving averages? I certainly wouldn't trust them as reverse/contrarian indicators, since seems so unlikely to me, and effect was weak anyway. Maybe just less trends happening, vs equities?

Daytrading,"The holy grail exists, but no one will help you find it. ","It is often said that the holy grail of trading doesn’t exist.
But even if it did, those who discovered it would never reveal it to anyone.

The reason why the market seems impossible to beat might be precisely because there is only one truly correct logic, while everything else is only partially correct, so it carries too many errors and therefore won’t work in the long run.
The holy grail is probably a hidden logic that is evidently almost impossible to find.

I find it amusing when traders say there’s no “magic technique” and that techniques must be adapted to the right context.
All traders know the market changes constantly, just like the weather changes. If it’s cold, you wear a jacket; if it’s hot, you go out in a T-shirt.
Okay... but the thermometer doesn’t change.

Daytrading,Revisting ATNM (Actinium Pharmaceuticals),"Abstract 
Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has an estimated acquisition value between $10.1 to $11.2 billion and potential return on acquisition of $57+ billion from 2031 to 2037. This valuation is based on cumulative revenue from the company’s unique, lower-cost, globally scalable Actinium-225 manufacturing technology, two radiotherapy cancer drugs, and its targeted conditioning drug. According to Stifel, the radiopharma field was the second largest value accretion from December 2021 to March 2024 at 1650.5% (the largest was obesity at 4002.6%) [58]. Since late 2023, there were 4 big pharma acquisitions of radiopharmaceutical companies that totaled $9.35 billion and linked to the Actinium-225 alpha-emitting isotope [1]. According to the Department of Energy, alpha-emitting isotopes are promising, destroy cancer cells and leave healthy cells untouched [2].” With global demand increasing for Actinium-225 to treat cancers like prostate and GEP-NETs, Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s unique manufacturing technology adds scarcity to its value [3, 4]. Since 2013, Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Memorial Sloan Kettering  Cancer Center (MSKCC), and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) have used beta and alpha-emitting isotopes to develop Iomab-B (pending BLA/MAA submission) and Actimab-A (pre-Phase 3) targeted radiotherapies for patients with refractory/relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia [5]. Additionally, Iomab-ACT is a targeted conditioning drug that is planned for clinical trials with the leading FDA-approved CAR T-Cell Therapy [33]. Combined, Actinium Pharmaceuticals will change the paradigm of cancer treatment. Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is an ideal company and a “holy trinity” in rare diseases. Stifel defines a “holy trinity” as excellent efficacy (lead drug needs to cure a disease or at least make a major difference in the majority of patients), long-term exclusivity (10 years), and orphan but not ultra rare (>1000 patients). Companies with “holy trinity” status have a median enterprise value of $3.1 billion pre-commercial and $11.7 billion commercial [37]. Actinium’s lead drug Iomab-B demonstrated that 100% of patients gain access in half of the time to a potentially curative bone marrow transplant and double their survival at 1 year. Iomab-B is protected with FDA orphan drug status and patent exclusivity through 2037 [25]. With “holy trinity” potential and manufacturing uniqueness, Actinium Pharmaceutical's estimated acquisition valuation between $10.1 to $11.2 billion is below Stifel’s median enterprise value that meets their “holy trinity” criteria. Actinium was assigned a BLA number, received positive feedback from the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (“CMC”) package, and is planning an FDA meeting to discuss the clinical and non-clinical sections in 2Q2024 [48]. Actinium plans to submit a BLA 1H2024 and their European partner Immedica plans to submit an MAA 2H2024. Commercialization is estimated in 2025 [26].",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1h0zis0/revisting_atnm_actinium_pharmaceuticals/

RealEstate,Update on the am I wrong to expect them to fix this before we close ,"I’ll include the text messages as well as the pictures of the repairs in the link. 

My main issue was the pushy sales lady who insisted we send the money right then and there. Even after I told her we would as soon as we made sure the roof was done. 

Husband got to the house, pulled out the ladder and they had not fixed the roof. I refused to wire money until it was fixed so they scrambled to fix and they did. 

The construction manger was made aware they didn’t fix things by Sunday so she should have verified the work before we showed up and didn’t. I think everyone just assumed we wouldn’t get on a ladder and check. 

They got it fixed, and it looks nice. Don’t asked me to explain where the holes were but according to my husband, who has worked construction, the chances of water getting to those areas is slim. So yes we wanted them to fix it but we don’t have to worry about mold. And that’s not a chimney, that’s just part of the roof line. We don’t have a fireplace. 

I wired the money after my husband checked everything and that meant that we missed the cut off for the funds to transfer that day but they were transferred about 7am the next morning. 

We closed and we are happy. I’m well aware that all new builds are shitty. All builders are going to rip you off, build sub par homes and so forth. I don’t need anyone to rehash that. And no, we weren’t going to just walk away unless they just refused to fix the roof. 

Also, just to clarify, we hired our own inspector.  This was not an inspector from the builder. This was an independent inspector I found and contacted. That’s who found the holes in the roof.

I am just curious how do people buy these mega mansions with ocean views, do they pay cash? do they finance? Do they also put 20% down like normal people like me?

I am a small business owner, I have white collar friends (with good budget and investing plan) saving up anywhere from $50k - 100k a year, and a after 5 years or so, they can afford a house in southern California, but I can't imagine the math to save up for a 20M mansion, I mean, you are taxed at 30% or 40%+ in California, so you need to be essentially making 2M per year to save for the downpayment, and then find a bank who can finance the rest of 15M+?

RealEstate,Best unconventional ways to sell my house fast? Help.,"Hey everyone,  
  
I never thought I'd be in this situation, but here we are. Long story short, I’ve just found myself in an unexpected bind and need to sell my house really fast—like, in a matter of weeks. I can't use traditional methods like listing with an agent or waiting months for the right buyer. Why? Because of a combination of reasons: a surprise family situatiom and some financial matters that I need to sort out quickly. I'm too worried about not being able to afford two mortgages.  
  
The house isn’t a fixer-upper or anything, but it does have a quirky layout, and the market here is a bit... odd. So, I’m wondering if anyone has advice on more unconventional methods to sell quickly—without taking a huge financial hit? I’ve considered things like auctioning it off, selling to investors, or even reaching out to local real estate groups who might have people looking for off-market deals, but I’m honestly not sure what would be the best route.

RealEstate,"Did the listing agent lie about ""other offer""?","We found a house we liked listed at $509k. Our agent suggested for a house that although move-in ready, needed to be updated, had foundation issues which was fixed (common in the state), old HVAC system, we would offer at $475k with sellers also covering closing costs. We didn't hear a response from the listing agent. Our agent contacted the listing agent and she replied that no response was a response as the offer was too low. Our agent urged her to come up with a counter. The listing agent then came up with a counter at $485k with closing costs covered by seller. Our agent was waiting for the counter and it never came so she went ahead and called the listing agent and she requested our agent send over a new offer (red flag #1). After the new offer was signed and sent, we were advised to get inspection and earnest money ready. We waited all day and so our agent reached out to the listing agent again. The listing agent asked our agent if this was our best and final offer as they coincidentally, during the day, received an offer for $505k with closing costs covered by the buyer. Although this could be true, it just seemed really coincidental to me.

The house has been listed since March 2024 and was pulled off the market a few months later to fix the foundation. When re-listed in August, it was with a new listing agent. The price of the house started at $565k. Since August, the price of the house has decreased anywhere from $5k-$7k. Trending-wise, the price of the house would've gone down to $505k in a few weeks anyway so the number seemed a bit too coincidental to me. This house has been on the market for 100 days and when we put in the offer, it was on for 90+days. When we wanted to put our initial offer in, our agent reached out to the listing agent and the listing agent was surprised and stated that ""no one has seen the house in a month"". So it doesn't seem like it was receiving a bunch of offers. It's also really hard to get a hold of the listing agent. Sellers also don't seem super motivated. Our agent recommended we withdraw and so we withdrew both offers as we don't like playing games and there are other houses out there and we are in no rush to move to a house immediately.

RealEstate,"One week from close, Municipal search blowing up deal (buyer)","Hi everyone, I could really use some guidance. I’m supposed to close on a house next week, but a significant issue has come up regarding the property’s accessory dwelling.

The house has a detached garage with an apartment (listed as a “cottage”) above it, including a full kitchen, 1.5 baths, a bedroom, and an office. My family planned for my mother to live there, with the added option of renting it out in the future. This potential for rental income factored heavily into how I valued the property and my willingness to offer full asking price.

However, the municipal search revealed that the apartment is not legally zoned for living. In fact, the town contacted the sellers just last month (October 2024) to warn them about misrepresenting the unit as a cottage/apartment and advised them to either legalize it or remove the kitchen. Unfortunately, this email was sent to an outdated address and never reached the sellers or their agent.  The municipal search uncovered \~25 years of correspondence with previous owners of the home, as this apartment above the garage has always been illegal and a known issue. The seller had to have known the unit was not legal.

To compound this issue, we also discovered that the in-ground pool was installed without a permit. Since the two big selling points for us were the cottage and the pool, these issues are major concerns. Adding to our unease, we couldn’t conduct a full pool inspection because we’re purchasing the home in the winter.

To make matters worse, the person from the town who sent the email about the cottage has since retired, and the position is currently vacant. There’s no one available who can answer questions about the property or its zoning history, making the path forward even murkier.

I’ve since requested an additional 7% price reduction (on top of a 1.4% seller credit already agreed to after inspection) to account for the risk, time, and potential cost of legalizing the unit—or for the possibility it might remain illegal. The sellers have flatly refused and didn’t counteroffer. Their lawyer says they’re prepared to relist in the spring instead.

My questions:

1. Am I being unreasonable for asking for this price adjustment? My offer was based on the assumption that the unit was legal.
2. Are the sellers making a mistake by holding out, considering the potential carrying costs and market risks?
3. Should I walk away, even though this house seemed perfect for my family?
4. Anything I am missing? I am a first time home buyer so this is all new to me.

I appreciate any insights, especially from those with real estate or zoning experience. 

As of yesterday, I have told the seller we no longer have a deal and we are walking away. Part of me hopes that they realize they are making a mistake and come back to table, my attorney said she would see if they had any interest in countering... another part of me says this is a blessing in disguise. 

Thank you!

RealEstate,Want to cancel after receiving seller’s addendum,"I’m a first time homebuyer in OK. We’ve made it through these steps: we signed the contract, had the inspection, and submitted our request for repairs. As part of the initial contract, we wanted certain furniture and appliances. The seller even offered more than what we wanted. The seller has said that they do certain repairs, and we accepted/signed that on Monday. 

Last night we received an addendum from the seller in which they want to leave the price the same (well, increase it, but give the difference in cash at closing), but they are wanting to take back almost all of the furniture and appliances and just give us the stuff we didn’t really want. We don’t need their stuff at all, we just thought it’d be nice to have it.

It was a big surprise to see this, and we don’t want to continue with them. Do you think that this addendum is enough to cancel the contract? Or could we send our own addendum to have them take everything and lower the price? I really don’t know how this works.

I won’t be able to meet with my agent until later, but this has really been stressing me out a lot.  Thanks in advance!


Update: Thanks everyone for the responses! I was just stressing about it overnight and wasn't able to communicate with my realtor because it was so early. It definitely changed my perspective on this whole process - we had thought we had a more friendly relationship with the seller than actually existed mostly due to the circumstances around why we're having to purchase a house so quickly. 

I don't really understand the legal stuff, but when I contacted the realtor this morning, she let me know that something about the way this addendum was submitted by the seller/their representative was not appropriate. I don't understand it, but my realtor says that it's enough that we won't have any problem canceling the contact.

The seller informed us that the repairs were made and provided us with receipts.  But upon reinspection, we discovered that the mold is still present.  We could visibly see it under the carpet.  All they did was to repair the baseboard, but nothing else.  
AC unit was also still dirty, but they claimed that it was professionally cleaned (receipts provided).

RealEstate,"Painting Rooms Before Selling Home - Popular Colors, or neutral white/gray/beige?","Hi Everyone -

Looking for some advice as we prepare to sell our home.

We bought our home 4 years ago, after it was flipped in 2017 at the height of flipper millennial gray. 

When we moved it - we painted all rooms with colors that we liked. Well turns out the colors we’ve always liked were actually becoming the next trend after millennial gray trend is ending. The colors in our house look very similar to current SW and BM colors of the year. (Mostly greens and blues, one deep red, some taupe).

We refinished the hardwood floors with like a smoky dark brown - but wayyyy close to brown than gray. Colors we have look great with the floors. Our tile in bathrooms/kitchen is light silver.

Well after 4 years in small house (starting with two pets and ending with 6 running around like crazy) we are getting ready to sell, and a lot of the paint needs to be redone.

**So my questions are:**

1. Assuming the extra paint from a few years ago we have is still good - should we repaint with colors, or go for all neutral colors? 

2. Assuming the extra paint is not good - would it make sense to still have colors? (Going neutral color may take a few coats in some rooms)

3. If we should go with neutral colors - what are some suggestions? 

One thing to note - best route may differ with the kitchen/living/dining (open concept) vs all the other rooms. In the kitchen all of the counters and cabinets are bright white, and the backsplash has like a faded green tone to it. So the bold green in the kitchen really brings it out. With a very neutral color these rooms would likely look strange. ",0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1h1nj4d/painting_rooms_before_selling_home_popular_colors/

RealEstate,"North Carolina - Split level house - Appraisal says lower level is a ""basement"". Buyer wants $100k off the price","I live in a split level house. All floors are roughly the same sqft. The lower floor has two doors to the outside - straight into the backyard without any steps. It has plenty of windows, too. There's nothing basement-like about it.

The appraiser came yesterday for the buyer's lender. My realtor just called and told me that the appraiser said that the lower level is a basement. I checked back on the appraisal when I bought the house and sure enough it also says basement there.

When we listed on MLS, it was for the full square-footage of the house for all 3 levels, and 'split level'.

The buyer wants $100k taking off the price.

My realtor is going to take comps of other split levels to the buyer's lender and try to argue the appraisal.

I have another house lined up that I'm buying and that deal falls through if this one does.

Any suggestions?

UPDATE: The due diligence period ended at 5pm yesterday. The appraiser got here at 4:15pm yesterday. My realtor only got the call today. ALSO there is no contingency for appraisal in the contract. Does this work in our favor?

  
UPDATE 2:  My real estate lawyer advised that there is no legal requirement to reduce the agreed purchase price since we don't have an appraisal contingency. So this means they're under contract for the original price and any reduction would be gratuitous on my part. They said if the buyer walks then they are in breach of contract.",380,212,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1h0irys/north_carolina_split_level_house_appraisal_says/

RealEstate,FHA with discount points or conventional with a 3-2-1,"Hello guys, me and my wife are trying to buy a property in TN. We are currently in this situation and wanted to hear your opinions. 

We are buying the house to live in it for no more than 5 years, then sell it or rent it out. I initially intended to put down $50,000 to get a sellers concession where they would cover closing costs and a 2-1 buy down (we have to put down 10% or more down for the seller to be allowed to give us that that amount concession, around 5.8% off the purchase price of $484,500, seller concessions are capped at 6% with a 10% or more DP). The interest rate would be locked in at 6.875% with first year at 4.875% and so forth. This seemed like a good deal to me, since the seller is paying for this and it would also give me time to hopefully refinance into a good rate before hitting the 6.875% mark again. This is essentially where we are at now, and just lack my signature to make it happen. 

Shopping around, I also spoke with a second lender. This guy is offering me to put down $48,450 which is right at 10%dp + $3,550.00 out of pocket and give me the same rate at 6.875, but with a 3-2-1, starting off at 3.875% on the first year. This is option 1. 

Option 2 with second lender is, get an FHA loan at 3.5% and use the concession to buy discount points and bring a 6.2% interest rate down to a 5.4% permanent buy down, putting me at around $3,450.00 monthly PITI and also adding 8k to the top of the loan for mortgage insurance. 

Knowing you guys were to move out in 5 years, would you go with a 10% dp and a 2-1 buy down and cheaper monthly payments, or 3.5% dp with higher monthly payment, but with more money in the pocket to invest elsewhere? I feel like its either save now on the down payment, or save as you go on the cheaper monthly payments.

RealEstate,"Home Equity Loan vs HELOC (vs Personal loan) intended for debt consolidation and planned to be paid back early. (Roswell, NM)","Had to almost max out all credit lines that were previously nearly fully paid off after emergency vet expenses and a variety of issues brought by a recent bad flash flood, but is now starting to be too great in monthly interest charges.  
Apologies ahead of time for the wall of text, but I figured I should provide as much safe to post information as possible and then explaining what I think the options are.

Income and asset info:

* Current monthly income is fixed at roughly $2,200 through SSDI and pension; plus $150 given by ex-partner that's part of an ongoing agreement.
* The home is in Roswell, NM and is entirely owned; It is the primary residence and valued slightly under $160k with roughly 48k or more in earned equity (may be wrong phrasing it's how much the home value has increased from what was paid years back). The hope is to begin the selling process at the latest by Fall or Winter of next year and allow the realtor to arrange the payoff from the Escrow.
* Previous credit score from the month before everything was above 710 and rising, but with all the recent expenses has drastically dropped closer to 560. Never a late  or missed payment on anything and there's only been one other time when one card became high in usage.
* All the balances were usually kept between $40-$80 on each credit line for easy pay offs and just used to grow credit.
* Normally would have at least $280 to spare every month to use on a couple streaming services and usually save the rest of, however it's quickly dwindling with the interest charges now.
* FEMA is saying they're offering assistance for damages from the storm and applied for it, but there's been issues with getting the inspector out to assess everything so I'm feeling even less secure about them helping.

Debt Info:

* The current monthly debt expenses would be one car payment, 3 credit lines, and two Affirm payments all totaling to about: $627.93 minimum/monthly.
* The current interest charges this month totaled to $77.57 and I believe the newly opened credit line for the vet bill may begin charging another $22'ish in interest starting in the upcoming month so it'll get closer to $99.57 in monthly interest although there's still money left in that account; however rather not spend anymore of it.
* The total debt including the car loan payoff amount, all credit lines and affirm is $29,899.48 *(25,140.78 for the car payoff)*.
* Assuming FEMA does not cover damages and any reimbursements; there's still around $2,500 left in damages to the house (kitchen circuit got fried from water getting inside the walls which surged other parts of the house too that is still unresolved and then plumbing damages which I already took care of.)

The battle plan:

*  Shooting for the stars hopeful would be getting about $36,000 from a HELOC with an initial large draw if possible to cover the car and all credit debt; then have a small safety cushion credit line left only for emergencies to avoid using the credit lines from there on or the same amount from a HEL. I'd need to get a fixed rate and the best possible APR % so it doesn't take too significant of a chunk from the sale earnings and still allows for a decently big down payment for the next property. Ideal payments would be between a $350-$450 monthly fixed rate which includes the interest charges so there's some money left for saving again; however it can be closer to a fixed rate of $600 monthly if necessary for a shorter term to minimize interest in the long run since it'll be paid off soon.
* If it would need to be a personal loan to cover the credit debt and have a small safety net to avoid using the other credit lines for emergencies; it would still require a fixed rate and a decent APR % that needs to be less than $170 monthly total that has the interest charge already included so it doesn't end up biting hard later on down the line.
* Either way, there must be zero to small pre-payment penalties due to the plan for moving out and selling the house within a year.
* I'm wondering what would be better between trying online or finding a place in person, but I'd assume in person may work out better due to the ability to explain everything. Any suggestions would be very greatly appreciated as I'm trying to get this all sorted as soon as possible, but also the best possible way. If any more details are needed please ask!

A little back story; this is for my very tech illiterate and disabled mother who I help take care of and essentially do all bills/finances for, but this has become far out of my comfort zone to be handling alone so I am looking for some more perspectives and any good advice from far more experienced folks I've seen on here. I've tried reading through a few dozen threads however it feels like these issues are very tuned to each person's own specific financial situation of course.  
I'm also currently figuring out my own financial situation in order to begin helping with her monthly payments as well, but it's currently making a bigger mental mess trying to juggle adjusting both finances along with all the madness.  
  
Side note: the emergency vet expenses were due to our 4mo. old kitten breaking his leg from being caught in his sleeping enclosure while rushing to get breakfast. Bottle fed from two days old so seeing him suffer wasn't an option and putting him down hurt too much to even think about. Admittedly both of us have gotten too attached now, but the original plan was strictly temporary fostering; however there aren't really any no-kill shelters here I'm aware of and everywhere has been full since kitten season as is. We also had to take in another rejected baby kitten who was about 2 weeks old yet only a few days old looking in size and has fought hard to stay alive; he's thriving now at 3 months old as of today!",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1h1jatd/home_equity_loan_vs_heloc_vs_personal_loan/

RealEstate,Virginia Appraisal Contingency v Finance Contingency,"Hi redditors, I'm not sure if I'm asking the right question: I (buyer) am under contract on a home in Virginia. The contract does not include an explicit appraisal contingency. I thought that if the lender's appraisal comes in lower than purchase price, then I'm out of luck, but the lender is telling me it would absolutely give me the right to back out, even though I didn't ask for the appraisal contingency to be explicitly written into the contract. The lender explained that since my contract contains a financing contingency, I can use the lender's appraisal, if it's low, and still negotiate further with the seller or back out entirely. FYI, I'm putting 20% down on a 30y fixed and I'm well qualified. Nothing in the contract explicitly states that I require an appraisal on my end nor that I'm waiving anything having to do with appraisals. The only section that discusses appraisals/values are the statements about FHA/VA loans which aren't applicable to me.  Lender's appraisal is happening in a couple of weeks, but I wanted to ask in the meantime. The seller's agent said that it's not a problem if the appraisal comes in low because I'm putting 20% down, but that's good for the seller and not for the buyer, obviously. I'd rather not buy at all if I'm paying more than the home is worth.  Finally, yes, I do regret not asking for that appraisal contingency.

RealEstate,Can sellers sue for damages after inspection,"We signed a purchase agreement contract approximately \~1 week ago with contingencies including inspection. Our inspector notated a significant amount of moisture damage in the basement, including likely mold and mildew. This made us incredibly uncomfortable but we were naive and signed a repair addendum asking for full mold mitigation (amongst other things). Fast forward 3 days, per a verbal with their listing agent and our agent, we were told they did not want to fix some of the stuff we asked for including cleaning and mitigating the mold.  We have been feeling extremely uncomfortable regarding the (likely) mold situation since day 1, so we asked our agent to allow us to pull out. We signed a release of purchase agreement and even stated they could keep our escrow deposit because we want to walk away from the situation. After they received our release they then signed the full repair addendum and refused to release the sale.

We are trying to start a family. I have no desire to move into that house with any possible mold, even if ""mitigated"". It is literally directly under the kitchen, we are not able to move past that. We have made clear to both agents we want to walk away 100% at this point.  Sellers agent is now saying they will take this to court.

House has been off the market for a total of 7 days and we have 6+ weeks until closing date. Sounds like the sellers may have issues with their move if this falls through. We have lost $1,500 at this point but we're not budging on this. My question is *if they do sue for damages*, what exactly will that entail.

If anyone has experience with either one, please let me know. They both seem pretty close and I know that this rate probably wont be the one I get at closing.

   * **Monthly Payment:** $1,150 (no rent credits)

RealEstate,Am I wrong to expect them to fix the holes in the roof before I pay the closing costs?,"Buying a new build. Closing tomorrow. 

We didn’t get to chose dates for ANYTHING. they told us when the first walk through was. Have us a 3 day window to have it inspected and told us when then last walk through was…which is today. 

Our inspection found literal holes in the roof that they just didn’t do. There are bricks they didn’t put in and you can see the insulation. 

That was brought to their attention same day as inspection and they have had 9 days to fix it. Again. This is their problem. We signed for the house back on September 9th so we could have done all of this a while back. 

So we went Sunday and while they patched the front that can be seen from the ground they ‘forgot’ to patch the stuff you have to get on a ladder to see. We took pictures and sent it to the construction manager as well as the person we signed the contract with. Both assured me they weren’t done and would get it fixed. 

So we haven’t been back over since Sunday. Husband is going over, with a ladder, today for the final walk through to make sure it’s done. 

So we get a text from the lady saying we need to wire the closings costs TODAY or they can’t promise the keys tomorrow (closing is virtual) 

I wrote back that husband will be at the walk through in an hour and as long as the issues were fixed I’d wire the money. 

She liked the messages and then just reiterated that if the money isn’t wired by noon today that we may not get the keys until Friday. 

I bank with capital one and they have said as long as it’s worried by 2 they will get their money the same day. 

So is this not how it works? Are we really supposed to give them money and hope they fix the literal holes in the roof afterwards? Or is this person just trying to push us to do what she wants?

RealEstate,"HOA fees for condo incredibly high (2-3 times next highest I've seen) because building is ""behind on funds"". Is it possible this will go down a few years from now?","We're looking at a condo which currently has their ""maintenance fee"" set to $1100 (Canadian) per month, which only includes the ""basic"" services of garbage pickup, lawn maintenances, building maintenance. The utilities are not covered, and the building does not have any amenities (gym, pool, etc). This amount is completely absurd in this market (the ""norm"" is 350-500 ish, possibly up to 600 for REALLY nice places). This place is NOT really nice, but just OK. 

Apparently the fees are so incredibly high because the building had fairly low fees for a long time, but then they realized that they're behind on their funds, so they raised them to this. On top of this, there are scheduled EXTRA fees of 3000$ for 2025, 2026 and 2027 to help cover the costs of a new elevator (building is only like 4 stories).

My neighbor's house is much bigger and my neighbor is an empty nester. She paid the house off long ago but took a huge loan out against the house with an outstanding value greater than the current price of the home. Is there anything we can do to prevent short sale taking forever and trashing her credit? 

I definitely don't have the cash to just pay off her loan, and it wouldn't be very smart since the home is worth less than the loan balance. 

With that said, since the loan is a twenty year loan with old interest rates, the monthly payment for the next 13 years is close to what the mortgage cost would be for a 15 year mortgage at a realistic cost of the house. 

Is there a mechanism to assume her home equity loan and just have her transfer ownership to me? Would it have to be a private simple assumption where she remains owner on paper until the hel is paid off, only enforceable by a carefully written contract? Is that even legal?

RealEstate,First Time Home-Buying Approaches,"Hello! I am looking to purchase my first home in the next year or so. I have about $100k to put down - likely about $130k by the time I buy. I am looking for some advice on the options I've been thinking about:

A) Purchase more of a long-term home that I know we can spend 15-20 years in and raise kids in. Put about 25% down on a \~$400k home and then save up for a cheaper rental property.

B) Purchase a cheaper home around \~200-250k and put down closer to 50%. Once the house is paid off in 2-5 years, purchase the ""longer-term"" home that we know we will want to be in and rent out the previous home.

C) Purchase the ""longer-term"" home on a first time homebuyer loan at the roughly 3% and purchase the rental home at the same time. So I'd be jumping into two loans at the same time (if that's even possible/allowed) but working on paying off the rental sooner.

I also have extensive construction experience and have the ability to do comprehensive renovations at low costs as another option. I am also open to hearing other approaches given my budget, experience, and situation.

RealEstate,am I crazy or is it an AMAZING time to invest in multifamily apartment buildings right now?,"am I crazy or is it an AMAZING time to invest in multifamily apartment buildings right now?

I was scrolling through LinkedIn and Jay Parsons (a leading multifamily expert) said new constructions of apartment buildings are at their lowest since 2013... makes sense due to high interest rates.

To be more specific, he's saying completions are outpacing starts by 218,500 units, a gap not seen since 1974...

In plain english, we're finishing way more apartments than we're building, and since it takes 2-3 years to finish apartments, we'll probably hit a shortage of apartment buildings in 2026.

simple supply and demand suggests both rents and property values will increase significantly in a shortage as the demand for apartments are sky high right now...

But that's not all... RIGHT NOW, apartment buildings have dropped by about 30% in valuation since the 2021 peak.

Add in the fact, the big institutional buyers who usually snap up these properties are sitting on the sidelines because of high interest rates....

Do we not get an amazing opportunity to invest in Multifamily?

Because there's less competition (big instituional buyers are on the sidelines)...

Valuations have dropped 30%...

And apartment buildings are predicted to hit a shortage by 2026...

So you can buy cheap just before supply dries up - which is exactly how many real estate fortunes were built in the past?

What makes this opportunity even more interesting is how bridge loans work in this environment. Because you're buying at a 30% discount, you essentially get a built-in equity buffer...

Plus, with interest rates expected to fall, your debt service costs could decrease over time, potentially improving your returns without any operational changes.

Speaking of which, you can use bridge loans to fund both the purchase and the improvements of the apartments... and we all know a dollar of improvements in multifamily can add multiple dollars in value.

Think about the sequence: You can acquire properties at significant discounts without lots of competition due to big dogs sitting on sidelines, fund purchase and value-add with a bridge loan,then implement value-add improvements while rates are falling, and then either refinance or sell into a market facing a historic supply shortage. Each of these factors alone would be interesting, but together they create a compelling opportunity for wealth creation... RIGHT?

Or am I completely going off the rails here?

Sorry for the long post, I'm just a bit excited... lol",0,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1h1fpow/am_i_crazy_or_is_it_an_amazing_time_to_invest_in/
RealEstate,Should I Buy This Real Estate Course?,"Hi everyone,

I’m considering buying a real estate course, and I’d like to hear your thoughts. Here’s what the course offers:
	•	Video lessons on topics like rental properties, buying strategies, tax optimization, pitfalls to avoid, and setting up a real estate business.
	•	Weekly live meetings with members where potential purchases are analyzed together.
	•	Access to a Discord group with around 300 members to discuss anything related to real estate, like buying, taxes, and transitioning to an LLC (or similar structure).

The course costs $4,000, but I can pay it off interest-free over two years. I feel this course could provide valuable knowledge, help me avoid mistakes, and connect me with others in real estate (I currently don’t have a network in this field).

However, the price makes me hesitant. While I believe the knowledge could help me save or earn that money back quickly, it’s still a big commitment.

What do you think? Is it worth it for someone with a good foundational knowledge of real estate but no practical experience yet? Or would I be better off learning through other means and building a network on my own?

RealEstate,Seller has ongoing litigation against a lender involving an ADU loan,"Hello, we are in contract to buy a real estate investment property in La Mesa, San Diego county.   
  
During our due diligence we learnt that the seller has an active loan they took out to build an ADU from a lender called Mosaic. The seller was working with a general contractor firm who helped them file for the loan. The loan is about 100k at 10% APR over 10 years.

The lender paid the GC in full. Permitting for ADU was done, some construction work and inspection was finished (foundation was laid, utilities were brought in). The GC eventually vanished and files for bankruptcy. This was a big news in San Diego, GC being MultiTaskr.

There is a class action lawsuit against the lender implying them being part of a scheme with MultiTaskr that have defrauded hundreds of people in similar way.

Now, our title company says that there is no loan/lien associated with the property. There are no active judgements.

I am wondering if in future the seller loses the case and lender somehow gets a judgement against the seller instead can they place lien on the property retroactively. Would we have any potential exposure?

Title company says no. But I would like to get advise from folks here.

RealEstate,"Should I pay these realtors?  Or report them for unethical behavior?
","In early February I (US resident) verbally agreed to have a Toronto realtor fix up and sell my deceased cousin’s house.  The realtor would receive a 3.5% commission - 2.5% for selling plus 1% for acting as general contractor on the $25k cleanout, painting and carpeting project. They said it was very important to get the property on the market for the peak spring sales period, and assured me that with my signature, they could legally fix up the house, list it and take offers.  Final sale would be contingent on formal Trustee appointment by the probate court. 



Before a listing contract was provided or signed, the realtor stated that, on advice of counsel, they would not to do any work until a Trustee was appointed (June at the earliest)  I viewed our oral agreement as null and void, googled “cash buyer in Toronto”, and found a buyer.  After the Trustee (a Toronto attorney) was appointed in October the sale was closed for $745k.



Recently, the realtor sent the Estate an invoice demanding $4500 for their “work”.  They claimed that they had obtained bids from subcontractors, and since getting bids constituted half the work of a  general contractor, they were entitled to half the $9,000 commission they would have earned if they sold the house for $900k.

  
After I challenged this, they responded with even more outrageous claims: 

“We had a verbal agreement, you provided a key and unrestricted access- which is legal \[sic\] binding to sell the property once it went through the probate process.""

RealEstate,Estate shenanigans and how to deal with them,"I am 24. Me, my mom, uncle 1, sister and grandma live in a house purchased by my grandmother. Grandmother passed away and the house is now in trust with my mom as trustee. 

Trust states that we have 15 months to either:

* Sell and divide the profit from sale between my mom and her two brothers. (Uncle 1 that lives in house has disclaimed his portion and given it to my mom, so now she is entitled to 2/3 and uncle 2 gets 1/3).

* Buy out uncle 2 from property and keep the house.

Some notes:

* There is an existing HELOC with around 116k left on it that needs to be paid upon sale
* Mom and uncle 1 have no income. Sister doesn’t make much. I make 95k pre-tax. 

The current plan is that I will buy the house as the only owner from my mom/the trust for just enough to cover the HELOC and uncle 2 buyout. The proposed numbers are:

550k appraised value (not yet official, just guessing based on similar properties in the neighborhood) - 116k HELOC - 30k credit for my mom (for money she put into house over the years plus a 5k credit for being trustee)

So 550k - 116k - 30k = 404k
404k / 3 = 134k uncle 2 payoff price. 

The loan would be for 272k for payoff, HELOC and closing costs. Again, I make 95k with little debt. 

I have spoken to a mortgage broker about all of this and this was her suggestion.

I also talked to a real estate lawyer about the following concern:

* The house might appraise for more than expected. This means a higher payoff amount and more money out of my pocket in terms of a mortgage. I can’t handle much more than the proposed numbers without nuking my financial future.
* Even if house doesn’t appraise for more than expected, it is unlikely that the house in its current condition would sell for whatever it is appraised for. We would need a kind of significant amount of money to get everything fixed up for it to sell at our estimate of 550k. Pool heater is broken, floors are a mess, need a new water heater, need to paint, etc. With the current plan, he might actually end up with more than anyone else because of this.

Real estate lawyer said that this is something we would need to negotiate with him. 

So, how would you deal with this? Is there a way for me to save some money or prevent him from having an unfair advantage if he isn’t willing to negotiate? I don’t think he’ll fight too hard but he definitely is not the most agreeable person ever. 

Could I get in trouble if I demand some credits as a “buyer” and deduct them from the sale price before the profit is divided and he is paid? Could we just complete this process and hand him a check without saying anything or will that bite us in the ass?

On top of that, the inspection uncovered several other problems not related to the roof like outdated appliances well past their lifespan, siding issues, and some safety concerns that can’t be fixed with DIY solutions. Because of this, I feel their offer is pretty weak.

It seems like the sellers might be in a hurry to close since they need money for another house. Plus, it’s winter, a slower season for real estate, and we’re in a position to pay cash, which would save them time. Their agent is aware of all this, so it feels like they’re trying to take advantage of the situation without offering much in return.

As a first-time homebuyer, this is all very new to me, so I’m wondering—am I being unreasonable for asking for more, or is my reaction fair?",1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1h0q9g1/negotiating_on_a_house_with_an_old_roof/

RealEstate,Should I sell?,"Hi everyone-

  
Looking for advice. I relocated out west this summer and am in the process of buying a place out here. I have a house back east that I purchased in 2019 and currently have as a rental. The property makes about $700 a month after paying the mortgage (I have a 15 year at 2.3%) 

I didn't mean to get into real estate investing but after moving in with a boyfriend I ended up renting out the house and have had great tenants for the last 2.5 years. I got word yesterday that they are relocating and need to move so I need to figure out what to do with this house.

I spoke to a realtor who thinks I can get 240k for the house and I currently owe 130k. I also replaced the roof this year so I have put some money into the property.

I am at a cross roads and see three paths forward:  
  
1. Continue renting and hope I get good tenants the second time around and all goes smoothly.

2. Sell on the open market knowing I'm losing a good interest rate but could take my equity and put it into my new more expensive mortgage. 

3. Sell to a real estate investor (I know the least about this option but I get calls all the time asking if I'm interested in selling.)

  
I see positives and negatives to both but am looking for advice from people with more experience then me.

ValueInvesting,Reminder: this is a value investing subreddit,"I keep seeing posts talking about how ""the market is crazy"" or ""these valuations don't make sense"" and ""I am going full liquid.""


This is a reminder to everyone here freaking out about the market, to try and put emotions aside, and put on their value goggles.

What are the key components of value for a given company?

The company's:

1. Free Cash Flow (higher is more valuable)
2. Growth Rate (higher is more valuable)
3. Discount Rate (lower is more valuable)
4. Capital Requirements (lower is more valuable)

If you move any of these levers around, you will change the value of the company. If these levers move on agggregate, then you change the value of the whole market! Lets get into it.



**Free Cash Flow**

Lets use our understanding of value to explain why P/E ratios are rising. Before we begin, let us break down (very simply) what the P/E ratio represents:


- P/E = Market Capitalization/Net Income


- Net Income = Earnings before tax * (1 - tax rate)


What is one thing we know about the coming administration?

Trump wants to lower the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15%. The Federal Reserve recently published a paper [showing that 40% of corporate profit growth from 1989 to 2019](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2023041pap.pdf)

How does this impact Free Cash Flow, the first lever of value? 


- Free Cash Flow = Operating Profit * (1 - tax rate) * (1 - reinvestment rate).


This is one point for the bulls. 



**Growth Rate**

Lets break down our P/E ratio further, and see how growth plays a role. For simplicity, lets assume on a market level, free cash flows will grow at the pace of GDP in perpetuity (a common assumption in valuation).


- P/E = Market Capitalization/Net Income


- Market Capitalization = Free Cash Flow/(discount rate - growth rate)


So we see above, if Net Income remains the same, Market Capitalizations can jump on aggregate if the market is pricing in high growth!

What are economists forecasting for the United States? Lets use the CBO estimates as our benchmark. The [CBO thinks](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-06/51135-2024-06-Economic-Projections.xlsx) that the economy will grow at 2.7% this year, which tapers off to 1.7% in 2034.

Great! how does that compare to other developed markets?


- The UK: 1.6 - 1.8% in 2026 [source](https://www.pwc.co.uk/economic-services/ukeo/documents/ukeo-july-2024.pdf)


- The Eurozone: 0.9 - 1.8% in 2026 [source](https://economy-finance.ec.europa.eu/economic-forecast-and-surveys/economic-forecasts/autumn-2024-economic-forecast-gradual-rebound-adverse-environment_en)


In my quick search, I wasn't able to find anything for Japan, but I'm pretty sure its under the US forecast (feel free to correct me in the comments).

So, on aggregate, the US is expected to grow above or at the pace of all other developed economies, and generally has very high GDP growth for a developed nation. This will influence the value of the market, as that growth component in the value formula above will move higher. 

This is another point for the bulls.


**Discount Rates**


The discussion on growth above leads nicely into the discussion around discount rates. However, lets keep our streak running and break down some formulas:


- P/E = Market Capitalization/Net Income


- Market Capitalization = Free Cash Flow/(discount rate - growth rate)


- Discount Rate (WACC) = Market Capitalization/(Enterprise Value)*Cost of Equity + Net Debt/(Enterprise Value)*(1-Tax Rate)*Cost of Debt


- Cost of Equity = 10 year treasury yield + beta(equity risk premium)


- Cost of Debt = 10 year treasury yield + credit spread


Lets start with equity risk premia. I talked about Developed Economies, but if we are truthful, no capital market in the world is as developed as the US (in fact it doesn't even come close). Investors can generally expect that US companies will be allowed to maximize shareholder value, without pesky regulators getting in the way (this is especially true now that Trump is in). 

As a result, investors in the US market will demand much lower risk premia. [Damodaran](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/datasets/ctryprem.xlsx) estimates it at 4.6% (he has his own methodology that is a little removed from what I discussed in the paragraph above). There are many ways to estimate this value, its generally kind of esoteric. Some people think this is negative right now. I would argue that it is lower than 4.6% right now.


Next is beta. This is easy, the beta of the market is 1. 


Finally we have the 10 year yield. This is like 4.3% right now. The options markets are pricing in yet another rate cut ([source](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html)) so it seems the market thinks this will go down, although 10 year yields have been rising since the first rate cut. Personally, I **personally** think the 10 year yield (which is what matters for valuations) will remain higher for longer until the US government gets its spending under control (lol). Others seem to disagree. 


Focusing just on the equity side (which is more important for now), we can summarize as follows:

1. The market seems to love US stocks, and sees the country as investable. 
2. The market seems to think that rates will fall. 

This is where you can form your own judgement, I tend to disagree with the market here in general.


Lets be contrarian and give a point to the bears here (my post my rules). 


**Capital Requirements**


The US market is dominated by asset light companies (big tech). I do want to note however, that these traditionally asset light companies [are no longer as asset light as they once were](https://www.ft.com/content/dc5b40cb-e446-4e2b-9faf-2d54720b33d8) owed to their determination to be AI leaders.

How does this fit into the math? 
 

- P/E = Market Capitalization/Net Income


- Market Capitalization = Free Cash Flow/(discount rate - growth rate)


- Free Cash Flow = Operating Profit*(1-tax)*(1-reinvestment rate)


So the higher the reinvestment rate, the lower free cash flows.

This is very surface level analysis, but if we assume that US companies are going to be more capital intensive, we need to give a point to the bears. 
 
 
**Points Tally**

2-2, a tie between bears and bulls. 


**What does this mean for us?**


This is just one, value centric, view of the market. As you have seen, I have made assumptions, have my own biases, and may be totally wrong. Still, this is the value framework, and it can be super useful to detach yourself from the fear mongering articles you amy see on a day to day. 

In my opinion, you should stop fretting over the market as a whole and **keep looking for value, like the name of this sub suggests**. This post probably confirmed some of the biases both bears and bulls have about the current market. However, value investors should do what they like and enjoy, which is find value in individual companies, both domestically and abroad. 

I hope this was a useful perspective (I wrote this up very quickly, feel free to ask for sources and refute/correct me in the comments).",113,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1h1wp9s/reminder_this_is_a_value_investing_subreddit/

Interesting note:

Kodak now has 1.4 Billion in cash after they sold the excess from the pension. They only have 400 million in debt. 

They could literally pay off all their debt and still have a billion in cash.

And the market cap is only… 532 million. That means the amount of cash they have is more than twice their market cap.

They’re also profitable and revenue exceeds 1 billion a year.

They could announce a $1 special dividend and it would only cost 60 million…. Stock is heavily shorted…

First things first: Steve Wynn, the company’s founder, was key to its brand and success, as they positioned it. But then, in January 2018, the Wall Street Journal revealed sexual misconduct allegations against him, backed by over 150 interviews.  
  
  
These allegations, some dating back decades, led to investigations by Nevada and Massachusetts regulators. Both found Wynn guilty and uncovered a cover-up by senior executives (what a shocker, right?). The result was a staggering $55M in fines for the company.  


After that, the market reaction was fast. $WYNN stock plunged 18% in just days, triggering a lawsuit from investors. They accused the company of hiding Wynn’s misconduct and exposing them to financial risk.  
  


Now, after years of legal battles, Wynn Resorts has agreed to pay a $70M settlement. So, if you owned shares during this time, you might be eligible to submit a claim.



While the company has taken steps to rebuild its reputation — like securing a UAE gaming license, reducing debt, and launching a $1B share buyback program — $WYNN still trades at $93, down 51% from its 2018 peak of $192.



And, has anyone here been affected by this? How much were your losses if so?

ValueInvesting,"MDA Space Ltd.  – A Hidden Gem in the Space Economy, Now on Sale

","Yesterday, MDA Space Ltd. stock dropped following Trump's comments about potential tariffs on Canadian goods. While the market overreacted to this news, savvy investors should see this as a **value opportunity** to pick up shares of a fundamentally strong company at a discount.

Here’s why MDA is a compelling play for long-term exposure to the growing space economy:

# 1. Unmatched Backlog and Revenue Visibility

* MDA boasts a **$4.6 billion backlog**, offering exceptional revenue visibility into 2025 and beyond.
* The company is expected to finalize a **$750M NGSO constellation contract** by *year-end 2024, adding $450M to the backlog immediately.*
* Management projects backlog growth to **$5 billion** by year-end, supported by additional contract wins.

# 2. Space Economy Exposure Across High-Growth Segments

MDA isn’t just a satellite company—it’s a diversified leader in multiple high-growth areas of the space economy:

* **Satellite Systems**: Aurora-class satellites cater to high-volume LEO constellations like Telesat Lightspeed and Globalstar.
* **GeoIntelligence**: MDA’s proprietary Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology powers Earth observation and government defense programs.
* **Robotics and Space Operations**: MDA is building the next-gen Canadarm3 for the Lunar Gateway, showcasing its expertise in space robotics.

# 3. Industry Tailwinds and Key Partnerships

The broader space economy is projected to grow to **$1 trillion by 2040** (Morgan Stanley). MDA is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth:

* **Telesat Lightspeed**: Manufacturing ramp-up starts in 2025 for this massive LEO constellation.
* **CHORUS Constellation**: MDA’s SAR-based Earth observation satellites launch in 2026, with over 36 letters of interest from potential customers already in hand.
* **Government Contracts**: Long-standing partnerships with NASA, the Canadian government, and defense organizations provide stability and recurring revenue.

# 4. Financial Strength and Valuation

At yesterday’s close, MDA’s market cap sits at **\~3.2B CAD (=2.2B USD)**, which looks absurdly cheap given its fundamentals:

* **2024 Guidance**: Revenue of $1.045–$1.065 billion (+30% YoY) with EBITDA margins of 19–20%.
* **Strong Free Cash Flow**: $205M in FCF last quarter, with positive FCF expected for the year.
* **Valuation Gap**: Peers like Planet Labs (NYSE: PL) trade at higher EV/revenue multiples despite weaker profitability and a narrower market focus.

# 5. Overreaction to Tariff News

The drop yesterday appears to be driven by fear rather than fundamentals:

* **U.S.-Based Presence**: MDA already operates subsidiaries in the United States and has a significant presence there. This should allow them to be shielded from any potential tariff.
* **Global Customer Base**: MDA’s business is tied to international customers, not just Canadian exports, making the tariff concern even less relevant.**.**

# 6. Why MDA Is a Value Play

MDA provides exposure to the **entire space economy** without the speculative risks of pure-play startups. With its diversified portfolio, strong backlog, and growing opportunities in satellites, robotics, and Earth observation, this is a company poised to benefit from the long-term growth of the industry.

Most importantly, **MDA stands out as the only already profitable space company.** Unlike many peers that are burning cash to scale, MDA is generating positive free cash flow, delivering consistent EBITDA margins, and building a foundation for sustainable growth.

ValueInvesting,Investing Resources: The Information Overload is SO real,"There are too many tools out there that all do something a tiny bit different and as a curious investor that is always questions I've always wanted to create a tool that can answer them. 

Being exposed to friends that have worked in finance at these huge banks, I realized more than ever that institutions have such a big advantage over us everyday investors. Not only keeping up with the massive volume of financial data but also having access to them, makes investing in the stock market way more difficult.

I created a tool that gives you access to those resources, it scrapes tens of thousands of 10-K forms and financial reports daily and uses an LLM that we've created in house to extract and analyze key information like earnings, sentiment, and market trends. It’s available to the public [here](https://castello.ai/), designed to help both retail and institutional investors make data driven decisions faster and smarter. 

TLDR: It's like chatGPT but for stocks. And is a huge time saver for DD. Not just a GPT wrapper, it outperforms every chatbot on the market in regards to financial questions, I can confidently stand on that.



Pro tips:

* Biggest obstacle with chatbots is knowing what questions to ask, our side bar helps with that
* Select a specific stock to ask questions about
* Try to ask a question that falls under these 4 pillars: fundamental, technical, economic or sentiment analysis 

I wanted to make a free tool that is accessible for all, hopefully it’s useful. Please let me know how I can improve it!",2,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1h1cqqx/investing_resources_the_information_overload_is/
ValueInvesting,TOYO Co Ltd. is a undervalued future growth play,"TOYO Co., Ltd. engages in the upstream production of wafer and silicon, midstream production of solar cell, downstream production of photovoltaic (PV) modules, and other stages of the solar power supply chain. Additionally, the company also manufactures solar PV modules. The company was founded in Japan in 2022.

TOYO debuted on the nasdaq through a SPAC with BWAQ back in July 2024. The company immediately dropped from its SPAC price of $10 to a low of $1.36 the month of July like any SPAC has done over the past 2 years. However since then the stock has rebounded back to $5.41 as investors start to review the financials and notice the valuation/growth potential. 

Recent News: The company just entered into a 150m contract to supply solar cells to a solar module manufacturer in both India and Texas over the next couple of years. This is a new contract with a new client resulting in new revenue for the upcoming years. The stock jumped 81% on this news yesterday. This contract will be reflective in the 2025 financials and 2026 financials.

2023 Full Year Financials : (Incorporated in 2022 and already significant revenue and profitability)

Revenue 62.3M

Income: 12M (profit margin19%

Market Cap:  240m (Expect it to be closer to 200m in the next few weeks as it sells off from its 80% move yesterday)

P/E of 29  ( was sitting at 17 P/E before 80% movement

  
Profit on new 150m Contract:

Assuming Margins of 20% we can extrapolate 30m of additional net income to be broken out over 2025 and 2026.

2024 Financials will be reported in early 2025 (reported on a annual basis)

  
2025 Financial Estimate (estimated 10% existing growth from 2023 on low end based on prospectus)

Revenue (62.3 \*10% annual growth + 75m new contract)

Revenue = 143m

Income = 27m (19% margin - expect this to increase as revenues grow - used low end)

Future P/E - 8.9

  
I would recommend keeping this stock on your radar and waiting until there is a pull back prior to 2024 earnings to enter. The company has been putting out a lot of news of new contracts recently so the price may fluctuate significantly in the mean time however this company is looking at a P/E of 9-10 in 2025 while its competitors are all either operating at losses or they are in the 25-40 P/E ratio. This does not factor in TOYO's revenue growth which is expected to be 50-80% a year after factoring in the new contracts on the horizon.

ValueInvesting,Started on the Value Investing Journey. Now what? ,"Hello All,

I recently started my value investing journey. I am currently following the beginner's guide posted on this sub. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/vrtavv/fundamentals\_guide\_for\_beginners\_step\_by\_step/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/vrtavv/fundamentals_guide_for_beginners_step_by_step/)

I am reading ""One Up on Wallstreet"" and so far it is going great. 

**One question I have is how one chooses a sector/company to invest in**. There are multiple sectors and thousands of companies and of course, you cannot research them all. There are so many potential winners and it overwhelms me tand I do not understand where to start. I do not have friends who are interested in value investing and the only source I have is Reddit. I love Reddit but most of the time people here are following the hot stocks. It is good that they are making money out of it (and even I am falling into the bad habit and investing in some of these hot stocks and making little money) but I understand that it is not sustainable. 

How can I find those big baggers? I do not want to invest in giants like NVDA as I understand that it is hard for it to grow. I would like to believe in a company, invest my money in it, sit on it, and let my money grow 100-fold. 

But how do I find a company like this? Out of all the great sectors and juicy companies. How can I pick the needle in the haystack? Where do I start my research?

ValueInvesting,Deep dive into Kering - From Timber to Gucci: A Legacy of Acquisitions,"**1.0 Introduction**

Let’s start with a fun fact. Kering, the company that owns brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, and Alexander McQueen, started as a **timber-trading company**.

Although it started back in 1962 and operated in a different industry, its DNA and management style haven’t changed much.

As I’m writing this, its share price is **down over 70%** from its peak back in August 2021 that was elevated due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

  
**2.0 The journey from timber to luxury**

***2.1 The timber period (1962 - 1988)***

The company was founded in France by François Pinault back in 1962 with a 100,000 francs loan from the bank. The business grew rapidly by **acquiring** many failing local timber traders in France, especially in the 1980s. By 1988, it owned 180 companies and 33 factories.

***2.2 The switch from timber to retail to luxury (1988 - 2013 - present)***

In 1988, it was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and the first transformation from timber to retail started:

* It merged with CFAO (A French distribution conglomerate)
* Acquired Conforama (French furniture retailer)
* Acquired Printemps (Department stores)
* Acquired 54% of La Redoute (French mail-order shopping retailer)
* Acquired Finac (French bookstore, multimedia, and electronics retailer)

The transformation from retail to luxury started in 1999 when it acquired 42% of **Gucci Group,** 100% of **Boucheron,** and 100% of **Yves Saint Laurent.** Today, Gucci accounts for 47% of its revenue.

François-Henri Pinault, the son of the founder François Pinault, became general manager of the company in 2003, and CEO in 2005. Under his leadership, the acquisitions in the luxury space continued.

It is important to note the divestments of their previous acquisitions (Conforama, Le Printemps, CFAO, and Fnac).

Its portfolio is quite diversified and includes:

* High-end clothing
* Footwear
* Handbags and leather goods
* Sunglasses and eyewear
* Scarves & other fashion accessories
* Jewelry
* Fragrances (due to the Creed acquisition)
* Cosmetics (in early stage)
* Watches

It is also geographically diversified:

* **APAC (excl. Japan)**: 32% of revenue
* **Western Europe**: 28% of revenue
* **North America**: 23% of revenue
* **Japan**: 8% of revenue
* **Rest of the World**: 9% of revenue

**3.0 Historical financial performance**

Its revenue increased from €15.9 billion in 2019, to €20.4 billion in 2022, and has contracted back to €18.4 billion as the demand for personal luxury goods started to decrease after the pandemic. 

Kering’s gross margin is stable at \~75%, meaning the direct costs are well controlled.

However, its operating margin is down below 20% (vs. 29% back in 2019). The explanation is simple.

**Reducing operating expenses is an incredibly tough job.**

When there’s less traffic (and subsequently less sales) in the physical stores, the operating expenses remain the same. The company still needs to pay the lease payment, its employees, the utility bills, etc. In fact, these expenses grow over time as there’s the impact of inflation.

Scaling down, by closing locations is also not a free option. Not only does it bring penalties for ending a lease contract earlier, but it also leads to losing all the revenue and profitability from that location.

The company is generating substantial cash flows, but I’ll argue the capital allocation is poor.

||all numbers in €m|
|:-|:-|
|Cash (January 2019)|€1.837|
|Operating cash flow|€21.541|
|Capex|(€7.772)|
|Acquisitions|(€6.559)|
|Debt|€4.887|
|Share buyback|(€2.034)|
|Dividends|(€8.229)|
|Other|€25|
|Cash (June 2024)|€3.696|

Between 2019 and H1-2024, the company generated **over €21.5 billion** in operating cash flow, or **a bit less than €14 billion after capex.**

Close to 60% of it was returned back to the shareholders via dividends, and an additional 15% through share buybacks. What’s left of the free cash flow, together with additional debt, was used for acquisitions.

Why do I think the capital allocation is poor? Two main reasons:

1. Almost 80% of the share buybacks were used in 2021 and 2022, the years when the share price was the highest (and temporarily elevated). A good capital allocator can recognize when the price is too high to buy back shares.
2. Its net debt position more than doubled, from **€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024. This is equal to \~60% of its market cap. The interest rate on their debt ranges from 0.75% to 5% and if the refinancing is done at a higher rate, it could significantly reduce its profit margins.



**4.0 What can be expected?**

Based on the latest investor presentation, there are three capital allocation priorities:

* Organic growth;
* Shareholder return; and
* Fuel high-potential adjacent businesses.

All of it, while having a **healthy financial situation and FCF generation.**

This is a good attempt by the management to summarize what to expect from the company. I find this slide a bit odd for three reasons:

1. On one side they want to return capital to the shareholders, which would position them as a company **with a goal to preserve capital and provide reliable dividends**. On the other side, its history is full of **acquisitions, which is the opposite of preserving capital.**
2. The center of the slide points to a healthy financial situation and FCF generation, while its net debt more than doubled in the last 5 years (**€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024).
3. Innovation is not a focus at all. Roughly 2 months ago, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced a partnership in the smart eyewear category. I see a lot of potential in this area that isn’t utilized (yet).

**Growing through acquisitions and distributing dividends seems to be the DNA of the company and likely what one should expect going forward.**

  
**5.0 Dividends**

The dividend per share has been steadily increasing from €4 back in 2015, to €14 in 2024. The current dividend yield is \~6%.

If the management focuses on reducing the debt and dividends (instead of borrowing to acquire more companies), Kering could become an incredibly appealing dividend investment option.

  
**6.0 High employee turnover**

At the end of 2023, the company had 48,964 employees. During the year, there were **13,403** new hires, and **11,275** employees departed. At first glance, this is no doubt a high turnover.

This sounds bad at first, but it is really difficult to decipher.

In theory, any company that has seasonal employment patterns will hire more employees (temporarily) during peak seasons. Therefore the increase, and subsequently decrease, of employees is normal. This is even more so in industries where the work is repetitive (such as sales and manufacturing).

In addition, 59% of the employees are Gen Y (1981-1995), a generation that is known for seeking career growth, which could lead to more job-hopping than average.

Given the reviews on Indeed, Glassdoor, and Comparably, there is no indication that this is currently a serious issue.

  
**7.0 The concerns**

**7.1 Balenciaga Advertising Scandal (2022)**

Back in 2022, Balenciaga faced significant backlash over their advertising campaign. One of them featured children holding teddy bears dressed in bondage-inspired outfits. This was rightfully criticized and labeled as inappropriate.

This brings into question the ethics behind those who are in charge of product development and marketing.

In addition, given how concentrated their portfolio is in the top 3 brands (Gucci - 46%, YSL - 17%, Bottega Veneta - 9%), scandals of this kind could have a significant impact.

**7.2 Preliminary investigation by the European Commission (2023)**

In April 2023, the European Commission initiated a preliminary investigation into potential antitrust violations within the fashion sector. One of the inspections took place at the Italian premises of Gucci.

An investigation of this kind does not imply guilt, but if a company is found in breach of EU antitrust rules, there could lead to a fine of a few billion euros.

The investigation is still ongoing, and no conclusions have been reached.

  
**8.0 Valuation** 

This is a mature market that will be around for a very long time. Therefore, here are my assumptions when it comes to valuing Kering:

* **Revenue** \- The industry is cyclical in nature, so there will be good and bad times. Based on the past, I do not feel confident that Kering can take market share, so I expect its growth to normalize at \~3% per year, which is in line with the inflation rate.
* **Operating margin** \- The luxury market is getting more crowded, and as argued earlier, reducing operating expenses is not an easy task. Once the demand is somewhat stable, I expect the operating margin to increase to 21%.

Based on those assumptions (and a discount rate of \~9%), the fair value of the company is **€27 billion (€220/share)** which is very close to the current price of **€224/share**.

This offers an IRR of \~9%, which is slightly below the historical return of the S&P500.

  
**8.1 The Bull Case**

Those who are betting on Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue growth and margin expansion through some of the following:

* Revitalization of Balenciaga & rebuilding its reputation after the controversies;
* Sustained growth in Gucci, and expansion of secondary brands like Bottega Veneta & Saint Laurent;
* The success of its newly launched beauty division, capturing market share from rivals like LVMH and Estee Lauder;
* Positive macro tailwinds;

* Utilizing pricing power;
* Integration of recent acquisitions;
* Reducing operating costs;

**If the management can pull this off, then the value per share could be 2x from today’s share price.**



**8.2 The Bear Case**

Those who are betting against Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue decline and margin compression through some of the following:

* Brand mismanagement & more scandals;
* Inability to revitalize Balenciaga;
* Inability to innovate around its primary brands;
* Failure to integrate its acquisitions & further poor M&A acquisitions;
* Negative macro tailwinds;
* Inability to innovate around E-Commerce;
* Supply chain issues;
* Competitive pressure;
* Increase in corporate tax by the French authorities

**In this scenario, the fair value per share could be below €100/share.**

ValueInvesting,Favorite homebuilders?,"Mortgage rates are coming back down and the U.S. has a housing deficit of 4-6 million homes. It seems like the new administration is going to cut regulations, which should be helpful for the industry. 
  
The whole group is still trading in the high single digit or low double digit PE multiples, which would be more appropriate for late in the housing cycle, not sure it is late in the cycle at all given size of the housing shortage.  
  
I like GRBK for its large land position. Many homebuilders have less than 5 years worth of lots or optioned lots in inventory but Greenbrick has 8 years worth. 

TOL is higher end which is nice for margins. Because there’s a higher percentage of cash buyers at the high end, it’s slightly less dependent on mortgage rates which makes the business a bit more steady.

ValueInvesting,"Stock is Trading at All-Time Lows with a Sub-$2B Market Cap, $600M FCF, $4B in Assets, and Over 30% Short Interest— Absurd.","Apollo tried to buy Kohls in 2022 for 8B (nothing has changed drastically about its business between now and then).

Let’s break down Kohl’s ($KSS). The stock is down 20% today, trading at an all-time low with a market cap under $2 billion. Meanwhile, the company generates $600 million in free cash flow (FCF) annually and owns $7 billion in real estate assets. with net assets of $4B.

1.The Business: Kohl’s still did $18 billion in sales for fiscal 2024, even without fully capitalizing on its Sephora partnership, which is boosting foot traffic in every store its been rolled out in (and they continue to roll out more) .

2. Valuation and Cash Flow: •	Kohl’s generated $300 million in net income last fiscal year and nearly double that in free cash flow (FCF): $600 million. Based on this quarter they’ll likely land somewhere in a similar ball park. •	Historically, Kohl’s has averaged $1 billion in FCF, meaning current results are already deeply discounted. And yet, the stock is trading at just 3x FCF. •	The discrepancy between net income and FCF comes from non-cash expenses like depreciation on their $7 billion real estate portfolio. This isn’t “money burned”—it’s accounting noise.

3. Balance Sheet Strength: •	Kohl’s has $14 billion in total assets/4B net, with a large portion being real estate. They own over 400 stores outright—hard assets that could generate significant cash in a liquidation scenario. •	Liabilities are about 11B, Yes, they exist, but Kohl’s is far from distressed, with manageable debt relative to their assets and FCF generation.

4. Short Interest: •	Over 30% of Kohl’s shares are shorted. Shorts betting on total collapse might not fully understand the cash generation and real estate value here. Any positive catalyst—a strategic pivot, real estate monetization, or improved retail sentiment.

5. CEO Departure: •	Kohl’s just announced its CEO, Tom Kingsbury, is stepping down—news that likely contributed to today’s selloff. But here’s the kicker: Kingsbury was adamant about NOT selling Kohl’s assets. His departure reopens the possibility of a real estate monetization play, which could unlock billions in value.

    •	Remember: Kohl’s rejected an $8 billion buyout offer from Apollo Global Management in 2022. That was four times today’s valuation.

The Bottom Line: For a $2 billion market cap, you’re buying: •	$7 billion in real estate assets (including 400+ owned stores). •	$600 million annual FCF, even in a “bad” year. •	A company that generates enough cash to pay an 11% dividend yield.

If you told me I could buy $7 billion in hard assets (4B net of liabilities) and $600 million in annual cash flow for under $2 billion, I’d say yes every time. That’s Kohl’s today. This isn’t a growth story—it’s a cash-and-assets story. You’re betting that the business, even if it declines slowly, will return far more than its current valuation. Or that someone with deep pockets will take notice and bid. Either way, this valuation is ridiculous.

Shorts, good luck.

ValueInvesting,What I noticed about the last time PE ratio was higher than today,"So S&P 500 PE ratio today is pretty high at around 27. The market seems a little inflated. Some people speculate of a crash. Warren Buffett holds a lot of cash. However, just because there is a bubble doesn’t mean it will pop. The last bubble fizzled, but didn’t pop.

The last time it was this high was when COVID started. Extremely low interest rate pushed the PE ratio all the way up to the peak at 38, Dec 2020. Then over 2 years, the PE ratio went all the way down to 19 mid 2022. We didn’t see a crash during this time, but we did see the stock market staying around the same spot (in other words, the “price” in PE ratio didn’t change)

- high interest rate starved the market of cheap cash, stopping the stock market from going higher
- high inflation reduces the value of the dollar, inflating the growth of earnings

ValueInvesting,Make the Macy's valuation make sense to me,"I was looking to the Macy's stock (ticker: M) and think it's probably too cheap right now. I could be wrong though, so if anyone here could tell my why I'm wrong then that would be nice.

So for my reasoning, I could build some highly complex analysis about cash flow estimates in Excel. Luckily, we're here in a value investing subreddit and not on Wall Street so I'll try to keep my math to the length of one napkin. I'd rather be roughly correct than precisely wrong.

So first of all, let's talk about Macy's assets. Their shareholder equity is about $4 billion. Roughly the same as the market cap! Most of the assets are prime real estate in US cities. A few months ago, some REIT was even willing to pay $24 per share ($24 per share * 276 shares outstanding = $6.6 billion) just to get these assets. They planned to throw away the business and sell the real estate in pieces. Luckily, they didn't do that. I think it would be quite sad for a piece of American history called Macy's.

Next, let's talk about the business. There is an idea that retail stores are done. I don't think they are. Even with all the fancy technology of today, ordering clothing, fragrances, or jewelry online is mostly a hit or miss situation. In most cases, you end up with the stuff at home and then have to send the wrong orders back. Not ideal. Especially if you are someone who has money but no time. In that case, you rather just pay a bit more inside a physical store in order to get your purchases done on the same day. Thus, if you ask me whether retail stores are declining, then yes you are probably right. I expect that the share of online purchases will keep increasing untill it reaches a plateau. Unless technology further improves (Smell machines? AI fitted clothing?), I don't think online purchases will go to 100%. Also note that Macy's has survived for 166 years already. By the Lindy effect, this means that Macy's will probably survive for 166/2=83 more years (see algorithms to live by for more info about this).

I think it's conservatively reasonable to assume that Macy's will continue to produce a net income from $0.5 billion to $1 billion on average over the next years. This is based on the numbers from the last years. The only risk here would be some extreme lockdown event like COVID. If you look through the last 100 years, I think we've seen extreme cases like that only once or twice. So I wouldn't expect it to happen soon again. The risk of a financial crisis is, as always, much higher. It cost them a few billion in 2009. But if you look at their balance sheet, Macy's is in a much better position than back then. Back then their shareholder equity was $9 billion, but with $9 billion of intangible assets (patents, goodwill, brand, intellectual property). Today they book only $1 billion as intangible assets. Also, the annual report clearly describes their debt situation and most of their debt has to be paid off only in 2027 and later. So as long as they can keep the business running at a reasonable pace, they should have no problem paying of their leases and employees.

One other risk is that of management. I always ask myself the question of whether management is honest or whether they will run away with the money. I believe that they are honest currently. The new CEO, Tony Spring, has worked 30 years for Bloomingdale's and from what I can see he seems to care about retail and luxury. From what I can find online, it looks like they are doing an honest job on running the business. Reviews seem mostly positive, and their marketing department appears to do a good job on social media. Regarding the recent finding on some employee having hidden money. The press release explicitly states they found out about this while preparing the current quarterly results. Given that they publish it now, this sounds like another sign of honest management. Of course, it would have been nicer if this wouldn't have happened, but given it happened under the previous CEO I'll give the current CEO the benefit of the doubt.

So in summary, you can buy assets that are worth about $6.6 billion for $4.4 billion, and get a profitable business with it too. I could be wrong though and gladly hear why.

ValueInvesting,Question AEG Model vs Residual Earning Model,"Dear Community,

I'm actually working on Penman's Financial Statement Analysis and Security Valuation (self-study) on the Residual Income Model and the AEG Model.

I think I understood the Residual Earning Model well enough to use for my own Valuation pruposes, but the AEG Model is giving me some sort of confusion, especially when i compare the calculated values of both models in comparison.

In one drill exercise i have to calculate the AEG and Residual Earnings for IBM using the following data:

Required Rate of Return: 10%

Book Value of 2010: 18.77 $/share

2011:

Earnings per Share: 13.22$  
Dividend per Share: 3$

2012:

Earnings per Share: 14.61$  
Dividend per Share: 3.3$

After that the growth will be 11% for both the EPS and DPS in the next 3 years..

When i calculate everything I receive the following data:

Residual Earnings: 2011: 11.34 $/share

Residual Earnings: 2012: 11.71 $/share

Residual Earnings: 2013: 12.19 $/share

Residual Earnings: 2014: 12.71 $/share

Residual Earnings: 2011: 13.3 $/share

AEG 2012: 0.368

AEG 2013: 0.479

AEG 2014: 0.524

AEG 2015: 0.587

So i can actually prove, that the change in residual earnings equal the difference in AEG.

But when i calculate the intrinsic value things get confusing for me.

In both Valuation-Models i would discount the calculated numbers accordingly by (1+0.1)\[t\] and add the value with either Book Value of 2010 for Residual Earnings or with EPS of 2011 for the AEG Model.

The last thing i have to do is divide the result of the equation in the AEG model by the capitalization rate of r to get my value per share.

I double checked my calculations and got a valuation of 58.37 with Residual Earnings and of 147.45 with the AEG Model. I know, that actually I havent used a continuing Value for both models, but this shouldnt explain the huge difference based on these numbers. Did I do a mistake in my calculations or in the formula or what do I miss?

I hope someone may be able to help me.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1h0nd7g/question_aeg_model_vs_residual_earning_model/

“In a Fortune Magazine interview back in 2001, Buffett referred to it as ""probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment."" This statement has drawn attention to the indicator's potential significance in assessing market conditions. The calculation of the Buffett Indicator involves dividing the total market value of all publicly-traded stocks within a country by the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By comparing the stock market's size to the overall economic output, this ratio provides insights into the relative valuation of the market. To illustrate this concept, one common approach is to examine the ratio between the Wilshire 5000 and the GDP of the United States. The Wilshire 5000 is widely regarded as the definitive benchmark for the US equity market, aiming to measure the total market capitalization of all US equity securities with readily available price data. By dividing this market index by the GDP, we can obtain a snapshot of the market's valuation in relation to the country's economic performance.”",3,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1h0bg1s/wilshire_5000_indicator/

ValueInvesting,Using LLMs to Automatically Generate Investment Reports,"Hello!

I spent some time over the last couple of weeks to create a process that would aggregate financial data from the internet and generate investment reports using LLMs.  It works by taking financial metrics I calculate in a Python script, and feeding them alongside company/sector text-based information as part of a LLM prompt.  I've got it working for companies in the S&P 500, and my ultimate goal is to automate this process so it sends me individual stock reports every week.  So far I think the results are pretty solid, and I'd love to get the group's take on it (and any constructive feedback you have as well!)

Below is the output the process generated for PCAR.  It's one I've seen discussed on the subreddit in the past, and has stood out to me in my own research.  I've got reports generated for every company in the S&P 500, so let me know if you're curious to see others.

    **Title: PACCAR Inc: A Solid Investment Opportunity in Commercial Trucks**
    
    **Introduction:**
    PACCAR Inc, a stalwart in the commercial truck manufacturing industry, has been a reliable name since its inception in 1905. With a diversified business model that encompasses the design, manufacture, and distribution of light, medium, and heavy-duty trucks, PACCAR operates under esteemed brands such as Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF. The company also engages in parts distribution and financial services, creating a well-rounded portfolio that supports long-term growth. Given its robust fundamentals and promising market position, the recommendation here is to buy.
    
    **Investment Thesis:**
    The core rationale for investing in PACCAR revolves around its strong market presence, consistent financial performance, and proactive adaptation to industry trends. As the commercial trucking sector heads toward cleaner technologies and alternative powertrains, PACCAR's investments in research and development position it favorably for future growth. Moreover, the company's impressive free cash flow growth and a solid return on equity indicate that it is not only financially healthy but also capable of delivering shareholder value. 
    
    **Company and Industry Overview:**
    PACCAR operates primarily through three segments: Truck, Parts, and Financial Services. The Truck segment, which accounted for 77% of total net sales in 2023, is at the heart of its operations, focusing on the design and manufacture of trucks suited for various hauling needs. The Parts segment provides aftermarket parts, ensuring ongoing revenue streams, while the Financial Services segment enhances customer retention through competitive financing options. The company’s stronghold in the Class 8 market in North America, with a 29.5% market share, and 15.6% in Europe, showcases its competitive advantage.
    
    **Key Drivers:**
    Several key factors are driving this investment opportunity:
    - Strong Financial Metrics: PACCAR has demonstrated remarkable growth in free cash flow, which skyrocketed from approximately $554 million in 2021 to nearly $2.93 billion in 2023, highlighting its operational efficiency and market demand.
    - Brand Loyalty and Market Position: The established reputation of its truck brands fosters customer loyalty, offering a moat against competitors.
    - Investment in Innovation: The company’s commitment to R&D for alternative powertrains aligns with market trends towards sustainability.
    - Stable Dividend Policy: PACCAR’s increasing dividends reflect its commitment to returning value to shareholders, with the 2023 dividend marking a significant increase.
    
    **Risks to the Thesis:**
    While the outlook for PACCAR is generally positive, investors should be aware of potential downsides:
    - Economic Sensitivity: The commercial truck market is cyclical and can be affected by economic downturns, impacting truck sales and, subsequently, financial performance.
    - Competitive Pressures: The industry is highly competitive, and maintaining market share could become challenging, especially with the transition to electric vehicles.
    - Market Dynamics: Any fluctuations in heavy-duty truck retail sales, particularly in North America and Europe, could influence revenues.
    
    To mitigate these risks, investors may consider diversifying their portfolios and keeping a close eye on economic indicators that affect the trucking industry.
    
    **Valuation:**
    Currently, PACCAR's shares are trading at approximately $115.55, with an intrinsic value estimated at $76.2 billion. This places the market cap at about 79.5% of its intrinsic value, suggesting that the stock is undervalued. With a target price set at $145.43, based on a conservative assessment of future growth and profitability, the potential upside is compelling. Valuation metrics such as the price-to-earnings ratio and enterprise value to EBITDA suggest that PACCAR is positioned favorably compared to peers in the industry.
    
    **Conclusion:**
    In summary, PACCAR Inc stands out as a compelling investment opportunity with its solid financial performance, strong market position, and proactive approach to innovation. The company’s diversified business model, combined with a commitment to shareholder returns, further enhances its attractiveness. Given the current market price and projected growth, the recommendation is to buy. Engage with your thoughts in the comments below; I would love to hear your perspectives.

ValueInvesting,Is Walgreens forced to play a dangerous financing game?,"The latest 2024 10K of Walgreens shows that it has borrowed $31B from revolving credit facilities and commercial paper; and also paid back $30B. However, its long term deb on the balance sheet is only 8B, which indicates those are short-term borrowing. Its finance seems so dire that it has to rely on those short term borrowings to support its operations, which historically has been a recipe for disaster. Those numbers alone is alarming, and it is even more alarming when it is such a huge jump from under $10B last year.



Here is what's written in its 10K:



>*In fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, proceeds from debt, primarily from revolving credit facilities, issuance of commercial paper and notes, were $31.4 billion, $6.3 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively. In fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 payments of debt, primarily for revolving credit facilities and commercial paper, were $30.5 billion, $9.0 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively.*

>

>*On August 12, 2024, the Company issued, in an underwritten public offering, $750 million of 8.125% notes due 2029. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with cash on hand, for the repayment and/or retirement of the Company’s 3.800% notes due 2024, of which the $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount is currently outstanding, and to use remaining amounts for general corporate purposes.* 

  
The first paragraph clearly states those are short-term borrowings.

The second paragraph indicates the company had to pay back the low 3.8% notes with more than double of 8.125%.",2,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1h0cd95/is_walgreens_forced_to_play_a_dangerous_financing/
ValueInvesting,EC Stock - Value opportunity,"Hey all, 

  
I think I'm gonna open a position on EC, it's got a P/E ratio of 4.58, it's at a close-to historic low, and I think the fundamentals are there. It's got good cash albeit with some debt, it's subsizdized by the columbian government and provides 3% of their total GDP. Gustav Petro is a leftist president but he has a right-leaning congress and likely won't impact the company any more than he already has, he's also pretty unpopular and will likely be voted out in 2026. I acknowledge it has worse margins than Petrobras per barrel, but it is still profitable with strong revenue.

ValueInvesting,Enterprise Group - Canadian O&G services profitable growth company,"Hi, long time lurker, first time poster.

I ran into this company less than a year ago. PE was less than 7 and the value proposition was great. I bought a ton of shares.

- amazing margins for a company in the capital goods sector
- works like a startup in the O&G sector. Has innovative products and has major o&g companies signed
- has a monopoly in Canada on the services they provide, hence why they can achieve such margins
- big potential for further growth. They provide services that offset emissions + save o&g operational costs.
- good accounting standards, no inflated assets
- healthy balance sheet
- good management & impressive 40% insider ownership.


I bought a lot when I first saw it. But now starting to wonder if it might be in the overvalued territory?

My main worry is that there’s seasonality in their revenue depending on how much is being invested in new fields in Canada. And their plans for further expansion in other sectors like mining are just goals at this point.

Would love to hear some opinions. I still own a significant sum but have locked in some of my initial 200% gains.",1,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1h0gmc7/enterprise_group_canadian_og_services_profitable/
ValueInvesting,TRIPLE POINT SOCIAL HOUSING REIT (SOHO.L),"I stumbled across this REIT while looking at the REIT market in the UK and the Valuation confuses me.

**REIT specific details (can be skipped if you are familiar with social housing)** 

Tripple Point is a Social housing REIT which is focused on people in need so people. So they lease the properties to Housing providers which then rents it out to the people in need. The rent is partially (in some cases 100%) payed for by the council of the region.

**Fundamentals (all summarised in a table below)**

Assuming the forecast the REIT will close the year with an EPRA EPS of 5.86 (GBX) and comparing this to the share price this would be a Price to EPS of 10.58. Now looking at the Debt the company has an LTV of 37.2% and debt maturities until 2028 and then 15% of the debt is due which could still be easily rolled over or even be paid off if decided to. Having an average interest rate of 2.74% secured on their debt which is significantly below the set interest rate of 4.75%.

Showing growth in rent adjustments with 6.1% rent increases as of the HY. Dividend coverage of 102% (which is indeed very low but can be explained) Dividend Yield of 8.8%. 



||
||
|EPRA EPS |5.86 GBX (Pence)|
|Price/EPS|10.58|
|LTV|37.2%|
|Rent collection of due rent|93.3%|
|Debt average Interest rate |2.74% (compared to 4.75% UK Interest rate)|
|Rent adjustments as of HY|6.1%|
|Dividend Coverage|102%|
|Dividend Yield|8.8%|
|NAV per Share |112.38 GBX (Pence)|
|Current Share Price|62.00 GBX (Pence)|

  
**Problems of the Company**

The REIT has two tenants (Parasol and My Space Housing) which are potentially fraudulent. Together they make up 17.7% of the rent. As of the last update of the Company (21.November) They agreed to transfer all the of the 9.6% of Parasol to another tenant (Westmoreland) and expect a rent collection of 75%-85%. The real problem is My Space Housing this tenant has stopped to pay any rent (8.1%) as of June 30, 2024. adjusting these numbers we would end up with a rent collection of roughly 90% for the second half of the Year 2024. This would result most likely with a dividend coverage ratio of below 100% but would be covered by dispositions planned which should be around 20+ Million GBP. 

**Communication of the Board**

One thing I like to look at is what the Board sees as crucial as this often show if they are aware of the problems (as with every problem to change it you must be aware of it first). The board communicated that they want to do share buybacks with the proceeds of the dispositions not specifying an amount. Also there was no talks on raising the dividend which I see as a good signal as this would lead to pressure and would not benefit the company overall. Also the dispositions are closing with a buyer found at fair value but the buyer is still working out financing options.

**Potential Outlook**

*This part is fully debatable as this is forward looking and based on assumptions.* 

My assumption is that they will stabilise rents with the new provider Westmoreland and will reach a rent collection of 90%+ in H1 2025. In the case of My Space Housing it is more difficult but they are in the process with Atrato Partners a Investment Advisor Group which could help them with finding either a buyer for the properties of My Space or a new tenant. Assuming that they can solve this problem the rent collection rate would return to above 95%+ potentially reaching 98%. Assuming this their dividend would be well covered and depending on the size of the share buyback there would be roughly 50 Million GBP in cash for acquisitions + Undrawn credit lines. 

My prediction is that SOHO.L will be trading at Book Value or slightly above the Book Value within the next 2 Years if they can solve the issue with My Space and continue to do share buybacks. Also I see it as potentially possible to get a 10%+ Yield (On the initial Investment) as they would be able to increase their dividend by 10%-15% in the next 2 Years. 

Please consider that this is based on a lot of assumption and that any kind of fire sale of the assets or further Tenants issues would lead to this not working out. ",0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1h0ehb9/triple_point_social_housing_reit_sohol/

400 Satellite / year production fully ramped up by 2027. (Current telesat deal is 2.1B for 200 Satellites) Substantial revenue potential not including the robotics segments.

Lets say 25% rev increase YoY for 3 years. That would be 2B Rev FY 27. Guided 20% EBITDA = 400M. They also aim to achieve 75% FCF conversion. 300M FCF / 120M Shares = 2.5

Lets say share price increased to 75 / 2.5 would leave you with a PE ratio of 30, when they’re currently sitting at 50 and the rest of the industry is negative.

They're also responsible for creating Canadarm which has been used extensively on the ISS. They recently received a $1Bn Grant for the delivery of Canadarm 3. They're leveraging this to create a version to sell commercial side.

They specialize in space robotics, being key contributors to the Lunar Dawn and Exo Mars missions and of course the famous Canadarm.

ValueInvesting,"NanoViricides, Inc. ($NNVC): Leading the Charge in Nanomedicine for Viral Diseases
","**NanoViricides, Inc.** (NNVC) is rapidly emerging as a leader in the burgeoning field of nanomedicine, offering innovative antiviral therapies that utilize cutting-edge nanotechnology. As a clinical-stage company, NanoViricides is at the forefront of developing drugs that target viral diseases, aiming to revolutionize treatment methods with its proprietary platform. Its approach uses nanomaterials to mimic the surface of viruses, effectively neutralizing them and preventing the infection of healthy cells. This highly targeted method promises to be more efficient and less toxic than conventional treatments.

# The Role of Nanomedicine in Viral Therapeutics

Nanomedicine, a transformative branch of biotechnology, leverages the properties of materials at the nanoscale (1 to 100 nanometers) to interact with biological systems. This enables highly targeted drug delivery systems that can directly impact the cause of viral infections with greater precision. Unlike traditional antiviral drugs, which target specific proteins or enzymes within the virus, NanoViricides' nanomaterials mimic viral surfaces, preventing viruses from entering healthy cells. This groundbreaking technology holds the potential to treat a wide range of viral diseases, making it a game-changer in the antiviral therapeutic space.

# NanoViricides’ Promising Pipeline of Drugs

NanoViricides' pipeline boasts several promising drug candidates designed to tackle both common and emerging viral threats. The company’s leading candidate, **NV-HHV-101**, targets herpes viruses, including oral and genital herpes, and is progressing through clinical trials. Additionally, NanoViricides has made significant strides with **NV-CoV-2**, a nanomedicine targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19. The company is also developing an inhalable version of this treatment, designed to deliver the drug directly to the site of infection.

In addition to its efforts against COVID-19 and herpes, NanoViricides is working on therapies for other viral diseases such as **influenza**, **Zika**, and **HIV**. These treatments are in various stages of preclinical and clinical development, with early-stage trials showing promising results. If successful, these therapies could be a crucial part of the global fight against infectious diseases.

# Stock Performance and Investor Sentiment

NanoViricides’ stock (NNVC) has been subject to fluctuations, reflecting both the excitement surrounding its innovative approach and the challenges of progressing through clinical trials. While volatility in the stock price has been a consistent theme, the company has seen a surge in trading activity due to recent positive developments in its clinical programs. Investors are closely monitoring the company’s progress, as updates on trial results and potential FDA approvals will significantly impact the stock’s performance. NanoViricides’ ability to bring its novel antiviral therapies to market remains a central focus for investors, who see substantial growth potential in its pipeline.

# A Company to Watch in the Nanomedicine Space

With its novel approach to antiviral treatment, NanoViricides has positioned itself as a company to watch in the healthcare and biotechnology sectors. The company’s commitment to developing targeted therapies using nanotechnology could pave the way for more effective and less toxic antiviral treatments. As NanoViricides continues to advance its clinical trials and work towards FDA approval, it could become a major player in the global fight against viral diseases. Investors should keep a close eye on NNVC, as its promising pipeline and innovative approach hold the potential to reshape the future of antiviral therapeutics.",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1h0ccj2/nanoviricides_inc_nnvc_leading_the_charge_in/
ValueInvesting,Climate Change Investment Strategy,"# Investment Thesis

This portfolio strategy aims to hedge some climate change risks by investing in sectors that will benefit to some extent from climate change. Thematically it's one of the most impactful changes across the next century for human civilization. I believe each year certain allocations will beat the market but overall I do not believe this will beat a S&P 500 ETF. To me this is a set it and forget it portfolio (my main portfolio is involved in high risk trading and I’m transferring some gains here then rebalancing with a slightly higher weighting on positions that are most undervalued). Some defensive sectors align with benefiting from climate change (utilities, consumer staples & defense tech) so this adds to the hedge component. Take from this what you will, overall I believe most people will benefit more from a market etf. Also feel free to roast this portfolio, I put this together in 2 hours, and still need to improve it quite a bit. 

The approach involves:

* Equal-weight allocation across ten key categories (around 10% each)
* Total portfolio allocation: 10% of total assets
* SPUU 13% as Performance Benchmark
* Investment horizon: 30+ years
* Strategy: Dollar-cost averaging profits into positions
* Focus: Major climate change impacts 

# Key Climate Change Drivers

* Increased global temperatures
* Increased utility energy demand
* Increased need for water technologies 
* Increased frequency and severity of fires
* Increased flooding and rising sea levels
* Increased infrastructure rebuilding and increased urban infrastructure
* Increased migration patterns
* Increased resource competition and potential conflicts 
* Increased need for agricultural inputs (ie fertilizer), increased agricultural production in Northern countries (Canada for example)
* Higher Inflationary environments, higher prices for materials
* Increased profits for insurance companies with higher pricing

\- The difference between investing versus speculating.

\- Stocks are businesses not just pieces of paper.

\- The metaphor of Mr. Market

Jason Zweig says that it is even harder today for retail investors because of the convenience of technology, the urge to trade, makes it easy to be addicted, but retail investors do not have to be the patsy, and feel like we cannot compete with the ""smart money"" where in fact, we do not need to play by the rules of those large institutional investors, as retail investors have several advantages. eg.

ValueInvesting,"[UPDATE] Stock Is Trading Like It’s Going Bankrupt, but $100M in Free Cash Flow Doesn't Lie","Update: I got ridiculed/vilified into deleting my post about Chegg by the comments last Thursday. Since that day it is **up 33%** and climbing while announcing repurchase of debt **AT A DISCOUNT this morning** (Chegg already had a net positive balance sheet)**.** Original Stock Analysis below:

**If you let me buy \~$200M in net book value and an additional $300M in free cash flow over three years for $175M today, I’d do it in a heartbeat. That is Chegg.**  
  
Chegg (CHGG) is trading at **$1.70 per share (NOW $2.25/share)**, valuing the company at just **$175M**, significantly less than the value of its **net assets of \~ 300M**.

Chegg is NOT losing money even though their earnings shows a ""loss"". Management recently took a **$481M goodwill impairment** charge. To clarify, goodwill impairments aren’t real cash losses—they’re accounting adjustments that reflect a lower valuation of past acquisitions. While this makes headlines as “negative earnings,” it doesn’t impact Chegg’s operations or cash flow. Strip away the accounting noise, and you’re left with a business targeting $100M in **annual free cash flow**, more than half its current market cap, this past quarter alone they produced $22M in EBITDA and $10M in net income. 

Chegg is targeting **$100M in annual free cash flow next year**, which means its market cap is just **1.75x its annual cash flow**. While the company reported a net loss recently, this was almost entirely due to a **$481M goodwill impairment**, a non-cash accounting charge that reflects overpayment on past acquisitions, not real money flowing out. Operationally, Chegg continues to print cash, even as its revenue shrinks. And let's be clear, they announced massive cost restructuring plans **bringing costs down by $100-125M in 2025. Adding to their ability to generate further free cash flow.** 

Let’s be clear: Chegg isn’t turning around anytime soon. Revenue will likely decline **10-12% annually**, driven by increased competition from AI tools like ChatGPT. This isn’t some rosy turnaround story. But the market is pricing Chegg as if it’s going to zero tomorrow, and that’s absurd. Even with slow declines, Chegg still generates **$100M in free cash flow** annually and a leadership that is working to maintain that cash flowing position.

Here’s the reality: If someone offered you **\~$200M in net book value** and **$300M in free cash flow over three years**, would you pay **$175M (now $225M)** for it? Of course, you would. Chegg is priced as though its business is worthless beyond this year, which simply isn’t rational. The market is punishing the stock for its negative growth narrative, but **at $1.70 per share (NOW 2.25/share)**, the numbers speak for themselves.

In essence, Chegg offers a classic deep-value setup: You’re paying liquidation prices for a cash-flow-positive business with optionality for growth. And if sentiment turns, a potential reversion to historical valuation levels could deliver **4x-5x upside** in the next 12-18 months. **Heads you win big; tails you lose small.**",36,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1gzm0gw/update_stock_is_trading_like_its_going_bankrupt/
ValueInvesting,How to handle your feelings for the one that got away,"Its been a roller coaster ride for me in the last 3 months.

Then rcatt almost 80% of my portfolio since august is in rcatt and its been rollercoaster ride for this stock.  So many times it goes up and down so i thought it would be the same until december since the army having a problem budget. So  isold rcatt at $3.15 to 3.5 after 2 weeks it goes $8-10!!!!!! 200% up!!!!And this really affect my mental health!!!

Last one of palladyne ai. After the. Contract anouncement of rcat i know palladine got more room to run so i bought at $2.06 then it goes $1.85 then i got scared again then i sold at $2.03  then after a day it goes to  $4+ 

I got 30k in my account if i got all of these these 3 i would have around £240k in just 3 months!!!! But no. I only got 30k because i dont have the diamond hands and it really affect me until now. 🥲

Can some one please help me overcome this feeling.it really affect my mental health

ValueInvesting,Enphase: Best-In-Class Inverters For Solar,"My full writeup can be found here: [https://prometheuseq.substack.com/p/enphase-best-in-class-inverters-for](https://prometheuseq.substack.com/p/enphase-best-in-class-inverters-for)

**Enphase Energy** stands as a market leader in module-level power electronics (MLPE), commanding a 55% market share of the U.S. residential solar market. By converting direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) electricity at each panel site, Enphase's microinverters minimize system-wide effects of a single panel underperforming due to shading or complex roof designs. This technological innovation ensures optimal performance and reliability, making Enphase a preferred choice among installers and consumers alike.

Currently, Enphase's stock is under pressure as dealers manage inventory and the California market continues to adjust to the new Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 policy. The consensus among industry analysts was that competition from traditional inverter manufacturers could erode Enphase's margins, especially given that the company sells to dealers rather than directly to end-customers. In response, Enphase has been building a competitive advantage through hardware reliability, expanded field support, and an increase in product features of energy management solutions. This involves incorporating hardware such as solar panels, storage systems, electric vehicle (EV) chargers, and heat pumps, optimizing for locational complexities including time-of-use rates, demand charges, and dynamic tariffs.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, Enphase reported a gross profit margin (GPM) of 50.3%, exceeding consensus estimates by 620 basis points. Warranty expenses imply a cumulative inverter replacement rate of 3% for Enphase versus 6% for SolarEdge (SEDG), demonstrating greater reliability. The company expects a resumption in growth from the third quarter of 2024.

**Inverter Technologies: A Primer**

Inverters are crucial components in solar energy systems, converting the DC electricity generated by solar panels into appliance-friendly AC electricity. There are three main types of inverter technologies available for solar installations: **string inverters**, **power optimizers**, and **microinverters**.

**String Inverters**

String inverters aggregate the output of groups of solar panels into ""strings,"" which are then connected to a single, central inverter where electricity is converted from DC to AC. With a string inverter, multiple strings of panels can be connected to the same central inverter, allowing some flexibility in solar panel system design. However, string inverters do not provide panel-level optimization, making them less suitable for installations that anticipate shading or have complex roofs. They are the least expensive option and are ideal for homes that receive consistent sunshine and have straightforward rooftops.

**Power Optimizers**

Power optimizers are located at each individual panel and are paired with a central inverter to complete the conversion from DC to AC electricity. Power optimizers don't convert electricity to AC themselves; instead, they ""condition"" the DC electricity to optimize its voltage before sending it to a string inverter for conversion. This results in higher overall system efficiency compared to using string inverters alone in shading scenarios. In situations where individual panels are expected to experience a drop in production throughout the day due to shading or other factors, power optimizers can help reduce overall system inefficiencies.

**Why Optimizers Are Better When There Is Shade**

Imagine your solar panels are like a team of cyclists riding in a line. If one cyclist slows down because they're tired (akin to a shaded panel producing less electricity), the whole team has to slow down to keep together. In a standard solar setup without power optimizers, all the panels are connected in such a way that if one panel's performance drops due to shade, it can reduce the efficiency of the entire system. Power optimizers allow each solar panel to work independently. If one panel is shaded and produces less power, it doesn't affect the others, and the rest can continue to produce at full capacity.

**Microinverters**

Microinverters are also located at each panel site but are not paired with a string inverter. Unlike power optimizer systems, microinverters convert electricity from DC to AC right at the panel. This approach leads to optimized electricity production when compared to using a string inverter alone in shading scenarios or on complex roofs. By converting DC to AC right at the panel, microinverters minimize the system-wide effects of a single panel underperforming.

Microinverters and power optimizers are often collectively referred to as **Module-Level Power Electronics (MLPE)**. Compared to traditional string inverters, MLPE provides shade tolerance and individual panel monitoring options. Consequently, MLPEs typically come with a higher price tag than string inverters.

**Sizing of Inverter Systems**

The size of a solar inverter can be larger or smaller than the DC rating of the solar array to a certain extent. The array-to-inverter ratio of a solar panel system is the DC rating of the solar array divided by the maximum AC output of the inverter. For example, if the solar array is 6 kW with a 6000 W inverter, the ratio is 1. If the same-sized array is installed with a 5000 W inverter, the ratio is 1.2. Most installations will have a ratio between 1.15 to 1.25. Inverter manufacturers and solar system designers usually do not recommend a ratio higher than 1.55.

**Batteries: Enhancing Solar Energy Systems**

Solar panels can only produce electricity when the sun is shining. Batteries solve this problem by storing excess energy to match supply with demand. Most home batteries use lithium-ion chemistries due to their high-power density, though one may still find portable or car lead-acid batteries.

**Popular Lithium-Ion Battery Chemistries**

1. **Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (NMC)**: The most common type, offering a relatively low price point and high energy density. However, NMC batteries have shorter lifespans, are less stable than other lithium batteries, and are more prone to safety issues.
2. **Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP)**: LFP batteries are quickly gaining popularity due to their relatively long lifespans, stability, and moderate price point. However, they have lower energy densities than NMC batteries and tend to cost more.
3. **Lithium Titanate (LTO)**: New to the home market, LTO batteries cost more upfront than NMC and LFP and have lower energy density but offer the longest lifespans, fastest charge times, and the highest level of safety as they are not flammable.

**AC vs. DC Coupling in Solar Plus Storage Systems**

Batteries can be either AC or DC coupled when paired with solar. With an **AC-coupled solar plus storage system**, solar panels produce DC electricity, which the solar inverters convert to AC. Then, the storage inverter converts the electricity not used back to DC for storage. When pulling electricity from the battery, it is converted back to AC. Customers pairing storage with a solar panel system that uses microinverters will need to install an AC-coupled solution because the microinverters change the DC to AC right at each individual solar panel.

With a **DC-coupled solar plus storage system**, solar panels produce DC electricity, which flows directly through the battery. The inverter converts any electricity not stored one time to use or send to the grid. DC-coupled systems limit participation in battery incentive programs because utilities cannot control the flow of electricity in and out of the battery.

**Inverters and Batteries**

Batteries need an inverter to convert their stored DC electricity into usable AC electricity. Different types of inverters exist, depending on whether the battery system is AC or DC coupled. **DC-coupled batteries** come with an integrated hybrid inverter for both solar and storage. **AC-coupled batteries** sometimes come with an integrated storage inverter, which only works with storage, meaning a separate inverter is needed for solar. Some batteries don't come with an inverter and must be paired with a separate, third-party inverter.

**The Value of Batteries in Solar Energy Systems**

A solar plus storage system with islanding capabilities can continue running in a home, even when the grid goes down. Even without solar, batteries alone can be worth it if the utility uses a time-of-use (TOU) structure. Under TOU rates, the cost of electricity varies from hour to hour, day to day, and season to season. With a battery, stored energy can be used to avoid pulling electricity from the grid when it costs the most. Additionally, with demand charges, the utility company tracks the maximum energy pull from the grid during any given hour (or even 15-minute period) per month and charges consumers based on that maximum demand for the whole month. A battery can lower peak demand from the grid, driving significant bill savings.",7,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1gzquqo/enphase_bestinclass_inverters_for_solar/

ValueInvesting,Novo Nordisk: Quick Analysis,"# Investment Thesis

Novo Nordisk is well-positioned in the market, driven by innovative products like Ozempic and Wegovy, which have transformed treatment options for diabetes and obesity. Under CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, the company has focused on expanding its product offerings and improving operational efficiencies, where I see a way for continued growth.

NVO has shown consistent revenue growth, reporting DKK 204.7 billion in revenue for the first nine months of 2024, a 23% increase YoY. This growth is supported by a strong pipeline of new therapies and a commitment to R&D. Novo Nordisk leads the GLP-1 market with a 34% global market share in diabetes care, further strengthened by the recent launch of Wegovy for obesity management.

Financial health is strong - impressive profit margins and a disciplined capital allocation strategy that prioritizes shareholder returns through dividends and share buybacks. With low debt and a solid balance sheet, the company is poised to handle competitive challenges effectively. Strong earnings growth potential and a solid market position.

The stock is currently trading at attractive valuations compared to historical averages, making it an appealing option for investors seeking stable growth in the healthcare sector. The current PEG ratio is the lowest for the last 10 years.

# Why is Novo Nordisk down this year?

In my view, Novo Nordisk's stock has gone down this year for several reasons. One major issue is that the company’s new obesity drug, monlunabant, did not perform well in clinical trials, showing **less weight loss** than expected. This news disappointed investors and caused the stock price to drop.

Additionally, while Novo Nordisk's sales increased by 21% compared to last year, they were still **lower than** what analysts predicted. There is also growing criticism about high drug prices from U.S. lawmakers, which adds to the negative sentiment around the company. With **more competition** in the obesity treatment market, investors are concerned about Novo Nordisk's future growth.

My fair price for **NVO is $124.92**. The current price of $104.09 is lower by 16.68%.

* Fair-to-Current Price (%): 16.68%
* Current Price/Fair Price: 0.83

I used:

* Discount Rate: 12% *(S&P 500 Next 5-Yr Growth Estimates is 11.05%)*
* Margin of Safety: 30%

* Future EPS Growth Rate: 17% *(See my comments below)*
* Future Dividend and Buyback Yield: 2.4% *(Buybacks and dividends; I took 5-year average value)*
* Total Future Annual Growth Rate: 17 + 2.4 = 19.4%

Despite the fact that Koyfin projects a 5-year EPS growth rate of 20.35% annually, I decided to lower the value to 17%, but the higher value is doable.

I expect a 19.4% future annual growth rate achievable since past NVO performance shows that the company is able to produce such high annual returns.

ValueInvesting,Kohl's Comeback: High Short Interest Meets Turnaround Potential ¿Potential Short Squeeze?,"**Investment Report**

Before you start reading the report, I want to clarify that this is not a deep dive into Kohl's. Instead, I focus on a few key aspects that could affect the share price in the short to medium term, as this is the information most of you are interested in. Kohl's is not a great long-term hold; however, it is a special situation that could deliver some gains.

**Key points:**

* **High Short Interest:** Over 40% of the float is shorted, making Kohl's a prime candidate for a short squeeze if positive catalysts emerge.
* **Partnerships Driving Growth:** Collaborations with Sephora and Babies ""R"" Us aim to boost revenue and traffic.
* **Upcoming Catalysts:** Quarterly results, a potentially stronger holiday season, and a possible share repurchase program could drive short-term gains.
* **Valuable Real Estate Holdings**: $10 billion in net property, plant, and equipment supports the company, limiting downside risk.

# 1.    Investment thesis:

This investment thesis on Kohl's Corporation is undoubtedly a controversial one, but the opportunity it presents is surprisingly straightforward. At first glance, Kohl's appears to be a failing company: declining revenues, shrinking profits, and operating within a challenged retail sector. These factors have led to an alarmingly high short interest of over 40%. In today's market environment, with booming opportunities in tech and high opportunity costs, Kohl's seems like an easy target for short sellers.

However, what many investors may overlook is that beneath its struggling operations, Kohl's holds significant underlying value. The company owns approximately $10 billion in net property, plant, and equipment, and even after accounting for $5.4 billion in capital leases and $1.2 billion in long-term debt, the real estate value alone is higher than the current market valuation. This positions Kohl's with a tangible book value of $34.50 per share. Furthermore, Kohl's has embarked on a turnaround plan designed to stabilize declining revenues and improve margins—a plan we will analyze later.

Kohl's core business still has strength. With 1,176 stores across the United States, the recent addition of Sephora shops inside Kohl's locations has been a key element of their turnaround strategy. Additionally, the company boasts a strong customer base, with 20 million active app users and 30 million loyalty members—clear indicators that Kohl's is not on the verge of disappearing anytime soon.

Moreover, Kohl's has been actively working on reducing its debt load, with interest payments remaining manageable at a rate of 5.12%. The company’s unsecured loans have a Fitch debt rating of BB+, suggesting a credit profile that is far from signaling bankruptcy. Despite its challenges, Kohl's continues to pay a sustainable dividend of 12%, while maintaining enough cash flow to further reduce debt.

# 2.    Turnaround strategy:

Kohl's turnaround strategy revolves around leveraging its extensive real estate holdings to introduce new brands and services into its stores, thereby driving increased customer traffic. One key initiative in this strategy has been the partnership with Sephora, which has brought standalone Sephora shops inside Kohl's locations. This collaboration has shown promising results, contributing $1.3 billion in revenue for 2023 and is expected to reach $2 billion by 2025. Building on this success, Kohl's has also announced a partnership with Babies ""R"" Us, with plans to open 200 in-store shops in 2024. This, along with other growth initiatives, is expected to generate an additional $2 billion in revenue.

Another way Kohl's is working to boost sales is by improving the in-store shopping experience. For example, they have introduced queuing lines in certain locations, which appears to be enhancing customer satisfaction and potentially increasing sales. Kohl's also aims to return to an operating margin of 7-8%, reflecting their focus on profitability as part of the turnaround.

In addition to retail partnerships, Kohl's is expanding its credit card business, although the significance of this effort in determining long-term growth may be limited. On a positive note, despite lower overall revenues, Kohl's has managed to maintain and even slightly grow its gross margins, showcasing operational resilience amid challenging circumstances.

The company remains committed to paying down its debt and building up its cash reserves, positioning itself for potential share repurchases once financial stability is further strengthened. However, it's worth noting that Kohl's has revised its yearly guidance downward every quarter, contributing to a more pessimistic outlook from investors. Despite this, long-term stock incentives for management offer a degree of alignment with shareholder interests, providing some reason for optimism.

Overall, Kohl's turnaround strategy is focused on maximizing its existing assets, strengthening key partnerships, and improving operational efficiency to restore profitability and shareholder value.



# 3.    Catalysts:

Kohl's presents a potentially significant opportunity, albeit one that could easily become a value trap—something that has been the case for years. However, I would not consider investing in the stock without some compelling catalysts that could lead to a major revaluation, possibly triggering a short squeeze. With the quarterly results presentation set for tomorrow, short interest has increased, leading to a decline in the share price amid lower trading volumes. The current market pricing reflects a worst-case scenario, with over 40% of the float being shorted. In this environment, even a slight positive surprise could cause the stock to surge.

The first key catalyst is the upcoming quarterly results. If Kohl's posts results that are even slightly better than Wall Street expectations, this could drive a significant rally in the share price, fueled in part by the high short interest. In the medium term, a stronger-than-anticipated holiday season could also provide a boost. There are early indications that this might be the case—for example, other retail brands like GAP have raised their full-year guidance due to strong holiday outlooks, suggesting positive consumer sentiment for the season.

In addition to these near-term catalysts, Kohl's is likely to initiate a share repurchasing program in the medium term, which could be the most impactful catalyst of all. A buyback program would create additional upward pressure on the stock price, forcing short sellers to cover their positions and potentially creating a short squeeze.

Overall, there are several catalysts that could lead to a significant appreciation in Kohl's share price in the short to medium term. While the market could still be wrong and the stock may continue to face headwinds, the downside seems limited at current levels, as Kohl's remains an attractive acquisition target for either another retailer or a private equity firm interested in its valuable real estate assets.

# 4.    Conclusion:

Kohl's is not a great company—not even close to being considered a good one—but it represents a special situation that could yield substantial returns with limited long-term downside risk, thanks to its cash flows and valuable real estate assets. Whether this investment pays off or if I am simply being misled by management remains to be seen. However, it's important to remember that being a contrarian can be highly rewarding, even if it means accepting the possibility of losing on most bets.

A comparable opportunity that comes to mind is my investment in Geo Group, where I bought shares at around $8. With short interest at 25%, the company offered strong cash flows and significant asset value that protected the downside. That stock is now trading at $28, less than two years later. While I don't expect a similar trajectory for Kohl's, it still offers several short- to medium-term opportunities for those willing to be greedy when others are fearful.

ValueInvesting,Zenas Biopharma (ZBIO),"
While not a traditional value play as the company the company has no current cash flow, it has the potential to bring in billions of revenue. I usually avoid biopharma companies like the plague, however this gem came across my radar. Their flagship drug obexelimab is currently in its phase 3 trials for IgG4 related diseases. The drug is also in phase 2 trials for other autoimmune diseases. They are expected to complete their phase 3 trials in 2026. The current data from the phase 2 trials seems promising. Current drugs on the market for these diseases bring in around 10B a year in revenue. The companies current market cap is 460M and the company as a book value around 350M. If you fire up open insider you can see the CEO and directors are purchasing. This would be a long term play as you would have to at least wait out phase 3 trial results, but if approved we could be looking at a potential 10 bagger.

ValueInvesting,How have you kept your faith in value investing in this current market environment?  It seems like buying what I’d call “Meme Cult Hall of Fame Spikers” has ironically been both more rewarding and more forgiving.,"What do I mean by “Meme Cult Hall of Fame Spikers”?  Essentially, I mean assets that ran up big in the 2020-2021 crazy market, and thus acquired a huge cult following.  But it can’t just be any asset that ran up big then. First, it needs to not be a now bankrupt company like Bed Bath or a nearly bankrupt company like AMC.  Second, it needs to have been a headline story - one of the “main characters”, and not one of the “side characters”.  The “main characters” are the ones that acquired huge cult followings and “came back” at some point in 2024.  They were also (and still are) heavily promoted as investment targets on social media (and to be honest about my suspicions: I think most of the “marketing” is done by grifters, cultists, bots, and social media algorithms).  Cases in point: Tesla, Gamestore, Palantir, and that one annoying asset that shall not be named because of rule #1.  And maybe a few others that I’m forgetting.

And here’s the rub – fundamentally speaking, the bear cases have generally been “proven right” for all of them.

Tesla – Growth went flat, margins went down, hasn’t lived up to promises.  No robotaxis or robots making money yet.  Valuation proved to be unjustified.  Doesn’t matter though, Tesla has rallied back now anyways.  Even if you invested near the top in 2021, you’ve now been bailed out.

Gamestore (you know what I mean) – Still a dying video game store company.  Nothing but conspiracy theories among cultists.  Doesn’t matter.  After the original “short squeeze” (which was actually mostly just a buying frenzy), there were echo spikes in 2021, and then a couple Kitty induced spikes in 2024, offering the chance of a bail-out for anyone who bought high in 2021.

Palantir – Was a meme stock that ran to a crazy valuation in 2020-2021.  Surged back now in 2024.  Revenues/profits have gotten better somewhat, but nothing I could see that justifies trading at a 50+ price-to-sales ratio valuation that it’s at right now.

That one annoying asset that shall not be named because of rule #1 – Proven to have nearly zero chance at mainstream adoption for its original intended purpose.  Doesn’t have any intrinsic value like revenues or profits to value it by.  Still only useful in enabling frauds, grifts, and other schemes.  Doesn’t matter though.  Even if you bought at the top in 2021, you still got bailed out in the 2024 resurgence.  Even the “dog” version, which was pretty much created as a joke, made a 2024 comeback.



The thing these all have in common: 2020-2021 “main character” meme bubbles, bear cases fundamentally proven right (generally speaking), but doesn’t matter because they all went back up anyways in 2024.  Fundamentals and valuations be damned.

It kind of feels like a cheat code when you can just buy a “Meme Cult Hall of Fame Spiker” during any dip down, and then take profits when it eventually spikes back up at some point for shallow arbitrary reasons that defy valuations and fundamentals.  And if you buy during a FOMO hype spike frenzy and get caught holding the bag after a crash, then no problem – just wait it out for a bit and you will get bailed out later on when the next hype spike hits!

Personally, I’d like to see the meme-cult market end for a good very long time, and perhaps soon it will.  But hey, I thought they had died for good in 2022 when their bubbles popped and their bullish-to-the-extreme bull cases didn’t fundamentally pan out.  But here we are – they’re back anyways regardless!

Meanwhile, try buying “hidden gem” undervalued assets based on value investing principles, and most of the time it feels like the market just keeps suppressing them in favor of chasing line-go-up momentum assets and spiking up meme assets.  Feels unjust.

So, with all that in mind, back to my title question: How have you kept your faith in value investing in this current market environment?

Oh, and P.S. -

Nvidia – I’m listing this as a “Potential Future Meme Hall of Fame Spiker”.  Its rally this year has arguably been fundamentals-driven (sky-rocketing revenues/profits).  But I’m guessing that if Nvidia ever disappoints big-time (like an AI-hype bust where their margins and profits collapse), it’s “not going to matter anyways”.  The stock will just crash and then spike back up later at times for shallow reasons by its cult following, much like Tesla stock does today.",45,80,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1gz8f3j/how_have_you_kept_your_faith_in_value_investing/

ValueInvesting,Appreciate some feedback on business idea around investing,"Hi all, I'm working on an idea which aims to help analysts on stock research. I haven't worked professionally on the field before and so I'd appreciate your honest feedback.

The problem I'm trying to solve is reducing the amount of time it takes to search and extract key points when researching a stock. Let's say you are thinking about investing on NVIDIA, and instead of going through all reports and news you'd be displayed a condensed summary of any specific aspect you're looking for (yeah, powered by LLMs as many other ideas). E.g The analyst would ask what are NVIDIAs biggest threats? -> the tool would combine different sources and output for example the the geopolitical conflict around Taiwan and its impact on semiconductors.

\- Would a tool like this make sense for professional analysts?   
\- Is chat the interface for this or there would be a preferred way of searching for this data such as structured format?
